/**
 * @defgroup WorldGen World Generation
 * @brief Procedural biomes, structures, and resource distribution.
 *
 * World generation is data-driven via lightweight CFG/JSON descriptors.
 * It blends biome palettes, places structures/POIs, and seeds resource nodes.
 *
 * Topics:
 * - Biome descriptors and palette blending (see `world_gen_biome_desc.h`)
 * - Tilemap utilities (see `tilemap.h`)
 * - Structure placement and rivers/bridges (TBD)
 * - Vegetation and environmental systems (TBD)
