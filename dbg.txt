Commit: Crafting Phase 7 Determinism & RNG Governance
 - Added rng_streams.[ch] with segregated RNG streams (gathering/refinement/craft_quality/enhancement) and seed derivation helper.
 - Added crafting_journal.[ch] append-only log + FNV-1a hash accumulation for outcome integrity.
 - Integrated journaling into enhancement/enchant paths.
 - Added tests: test_crafting_phase7_rng_journal (stream independence + hash chain) and test_crafting_phase7_determinism (replay reproducibility).
 - Updated roadmap (Phase 7 all Done) and README with new Phase 7 bullet.
