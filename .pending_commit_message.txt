feat(hit-system): mark phases 1-3 complete; add basic knockback & flash tuning; introduce hitbox tuning JSON persistence & path resolution; add knockback unit test

Details:
- Completed roadmap status updates for Phases 1-3 (data structs, runtime capsule, overlap pipeline).
- Implemented strength-scaled knockback using sweep normals with clamped magnitude.
- Added hitbox_tuning.json auto path resolution (supports build dir, assets/, ../assets/) and hotkey save helper.
- Added runtime tuning struct & hotkeys (CTRL/ALT + number) to adjust player capsule & enemy radius/offset.
- Extended debug overlay to draw enemy circles with tuning adjustments.
- Added unit test test_knockback_basic ensuring magnitude scaling and cap.
- Updated roadmap to reflect partial Phase 4 progress; enumerated remaining feedback tasks.
Inventory System Phase 4.4 Completion & Roadmap Sync

Summary:
- Implemented quick action bar API wrappers for saved searches: enumerate/apply by index (`rogue_inventory_quick_actions_count`, `rogue_inventory_quick_action_name`, `rogue_inventory_quick_action_apply`).
- Extended public header to document quick action layer and diagnostics availability.
- Added new unit test `test_inventory_phase4_quick_actions` validating enumeration and application path.
- Updated tests CMake to include quick action test.
- Roadmap adjustments: Phase 3.3 auto-tag rules marked Done (already implemented earlier); Phase 4.4 marked Done with note on quick action wrappers.
- README Phase 4 paragraph updated to reflect quick action bar completion and new test; pending list trimmed (UI binding item removed).

Technical Notes:
- Quick actions reuse saved searches; no duplicated storage, ensuring O(1) index indirection.
- Index apply performs name fetch then existing quick-apply path; safe if searches mutate (indices remain dense 0..n-1 until restart).
- No performance regression expected (single extra name copy on apply).

Next Steps (remaining Phase 4 work): parser fuzz harness, richer parse diagnostics (specific position), cache hit ratio & perf/leak guards, extended mutation wiring (durability/quality/affix changes) before marking 4.1/4.5/4.7 complete.
