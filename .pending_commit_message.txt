progression: Phase 3 Ratings & Diminishing Returns System

Added rating categories (crit/haste/avoidance) with multi-band diminishing returns curves and integration into combat strike & stat cache.

Details:
- progression_ratings.[ch] with rogue_rating_effective_percent / rogue_rating_apply_chain
- Player struct & persistence (CRIT_R/HASTE_R/AVOID_R)
- Stat cache raw & effective rating fields
- Combat crit chance includes rating (cap 80%)
- Unit test test_progression_phase3_ratings (monotonic, continuity, caps)
- Roadmap Phase 3 marked Done; README progression row updated

Verification: test passes (progression_phase3_ratings: OK) with SDL2 build.

progression: Phase 4 Maze Skill Graph Framework

Implemented progression maze wrapper (progression_maze.[ch]) layering metadata atop geometric skill maze:
- Node meta: ring-derived level & attribute requirements, point cost ramp, flags, adjacency indices.
- Procedural optional branch augmentation (~5% new leaves) & difficulty tagging for dense inner hubs.
- Shortest cost path utility (Dijkstra) and gating predicate API.
- Orphan audit & optional node counting.
- Unit test test_progression_phase4_maze (build, gating, path cost sanity, orphan audit) added to test suite.
- Roadmap Phase 4 marked Done; README progression row updated.

Verification: SDL2 build + test_progression_phase4_maze passes.
