Phase 14 (Optimization & Memory) - Parallel River Carving & Docs Update

WorldGen:
 - Implemented initial parallel river carving when optimization parallel flag enabled (Windows). Collects ordered river start points, partitions list into contiguous chunks, launches threads via CreateThread. Deterministic because input ordering + per-river carve logic unchanged; overlapping writes (rare) are idempotent (same tile set to water).
 - Added sequential fallback on non-Windows or when flag disabled.

Optimization Scaffolding:
 - Exposed internal accessor for parallel enable already consumed by macro generator.
 - Maintained SIMD stub path (unchanged functionally) preparing for true vector kernels.

Documentation:
 - Roadmap Phase 14: Marked 14.3 Done (initial), clarified remaining 14.2 (true SIMD) & 14.4 (regression guard) partial work.
 - README Phase 14 section expanded: details arena allocator, SIMD batching, new parallel river carving, benchmark baseline, next steps.

Next Planned (not in this commit): parallel biome classification, true vectorized noise & erosion kernels, regression timing tolerance + CI gating, determinism test comparing parallel enabled vs disabled hash outputs.

No functional changes outside worldgen; existing tests pass locally (macro phase 2 test exercised with parallel flag both off/on).
