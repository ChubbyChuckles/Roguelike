Inventory System Phase 4.4 Completion & Roadmap Sync

Summary:
- Implemented quick action bar API wrappers for saved searches: enumerate/apply by index (`rogue_inventory_quick_actions_count`, `rogue_inventory_quick_action_name`, `rogue_inventory_quick_action_apply`).
- Extended public header to document quick action layer and diagnostics availability.
- Added new unit test `test_inventory_phase4_quick_actions` validating enumeration and application path.
- Updated tests CMake to include quick action test.
- Roadmap adjustments: Phase 3.3 auto-tag rules marked Done (already implemented earlier); Phase 4.4 marked Done with note on quick action wrappers.
- README Phase 4 paragraph updated to reflect quick action bar completion and new test; pending list trimmed (UI binding item removed).

Technical Notes:
- Quick actions reuse saved searches; no duplicated storage, ensuring O(1) index indirection.
- Index apply performs name fetch then existing quick-apply path; safe if searches mutate (indices remain dense 0..n-1 until restart).
- No performance regression expected (single extra name copy on apply).

Next Steps (remaining Phase 4 work): parser fuzz harness, richer parse diagnostics (specific position), cache hit ratio & perf/leak guards, extended mutation wiring (durability/quality/affix changes) before marking 4.1/4.5/4.7 complete.
