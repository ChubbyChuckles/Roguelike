feat(progression): implement Phase 0 stat taxonomy (canonical registry, ID ranges, fingerprint, tests)

Adds progression_stats.[ch] providing stable stat enumeration with categorized ID ranges:
 - Primary (0-99): STR/DEX/VIT/INT
 - Derived (100-199): crit chance/damage, DPS/EHP/toughness/mobility/sustain (placeholder), resistances
 - Rating placeholders (200-299): crit/haste/avoidance rating (reserved for Phase 3 DR curves)
 - Modifier placeholders (300-399): generic damage/speed modifiers
 - Reserved (400-499) future expansion (mastery, micro-nodes)

Includes deterministic registry fingerprint API and unit test `test_progression_phase0_taxonomy` validating:
 - Strict ascending unique IDs & codes
 - Category mapping by range
 - Stable fingerprint repeatability
 - Reserved placeholders flagged

Roadmap Phase 0 sections marked Done with implementation notes; README Progression matrix row updated to reflect taxonomy completion.
