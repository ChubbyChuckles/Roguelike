Combat Phase 7.7 (partial) â€“ infusion componentization + new test & docs

Summary:
- Refactored combat strike damage pipeline to decompose infused attacks into discrete components (physical + fire/frost/arcane) each mitigated independently. Physical-only penetration preserved (flat then %), preventing unintended elemental penetration.
- Emitting individual RogueDamageEvent entries per active component followed by an aggregate summary event (foundation for future analytics & elemental effect hooks).
- Adjusted durability, familiarity, poise, crit layering, and execution logic to operate on the aggregate without changing prior outcomes (aside from intentional redistribution differences under resistances).
- Added new unit test `test_combat_phase7_infusion_split_events` ensuring elemental infusion redistributes damage and suffers extra mitigation versus pure physical when target has high elemental resist (verifies per-component path correctness).
- Updated implementation plan (Phase 7.7 status & remaining tasks) and README (Phase 7 section) to reflect componentized infusion handling and the new test.

Remaining Phase 7.7 targets (next commits): stance frame timing verification test, familiarity soft-cap boundary test, encumbrance mobility curve regression test, per-component event ordering/count test.

No regressions observed in existing Phase 7 test suite; warnings resolved (removed constant-condition macro & unused variable). Ready for incremental expansion of test coverage.
