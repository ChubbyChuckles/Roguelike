Equipment Phase 8.1 â€“ Non-linear Durability Model
-------------------------------------------------
Adds centralized durability helper module (`core/durability.[ch]`) implementing logarithmic severity scaling with rarity mitigation:
	loss = ceil(base * log2(1 + severity/25) * (1 / (1 + 0.35 * rarity))) with base=2 for severity>=50 else 1 (minimum 1 when severity>0).
Higher rarity items now lose proportionally less durability per identical event; extreme severities exhibit diminishing returns.
Introduces API `rogue_item_instance_apply_durability_event(inst,severity)` for later migration of fixed decrement call sites.
Unit test `test_equipment_phase8_durability_model` covers:
	* Rarity differential (epic <= common loss for identical severities)
	* Monotonic non-decreasing loss across ascending severities.
Roadmap: Phase 8.1 marked Done; Phase 8.6 marked Partial (additional repair cost monotonicity, salvage yield & fracture tests pending subsequent slices).
README updated with Phase 8.1 section.
