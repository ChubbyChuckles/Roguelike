integration(sync v5.8): snapshot double-buffer, delta round-trip, rollback cursor; tests passing

– Snapshot Manager: introduce per-system double-buffered snapshots so prior snapshot pointers remain valid across subsequent capture; adjust dump and reset; keep version/hash/timestamp monotonic; fix replay helper for new layout.
– Delta Sync: byte-range delta builder/apply path validated; stats for generated/applied bytes; guards for version/system mismatches.
– Rollback Manager: expand max systems to 512; store FULL or DELTA entries vs latest FULL to save memory; add traversal cursor so step_back(1) returns latest and subsequent calls walk older entries; reset cursor on new captures; maintain detailed stats and event log.
– Tests (Phase 5.8): add and pass unit tests for snapshot consistency, delta correctness, transaction isolation/timeout/prepare-failure, rollback step semantics, and multi-system integration. All pass under MSVC warnings-as-errors.
– Docs/Roadmap: mark Phase 5.8 items Done; README changelog updated. Build remains SDL2 with parallel MSBuild (/m:8).

combat: fix familiarity progression test; suppress knockback in forced-attack harness; early hit-mask reset

– combat_strike: gate knockback position updates behind runtime rogue_force_attack_active to keep targets stationary in unit tests; preserves gameplay knockback normally.
– combat_strike: reset per-strike hit mask at function start when processed/emitted masks are zero to support direct strike invocation by tests.
– weapons: familiarity accrues per hit; 10% cap applied; validated against test_combat_phase7_familiarity_cap.
