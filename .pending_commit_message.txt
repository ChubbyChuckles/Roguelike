Start screen: Phase 6 settings & accessibility overlay

- Add Settings overlay accessible from Start screen menu (keyboard/controller navigation)
- Toggles: Reduced Motion (global), High Contrast (subtle darken overlay); Narration stub placeholder
- DPI/UI scale quick adjust: LEFT/RIGHT in settings increments by 5% (50–300%), new ui_theme setter
- Background render honors High Contrast overlay; default logging remains quiet (WARN)
- Roadmap updated (Phase 6.1–6.3 Done); README to follow with brief usage notes

Build & tests:
- Built Debug with SDL2 (-j8) on Windows; start screen test subset passed (5/5)
- No regressions observed in start screen suite; broader suite unchanged
Start screen: most-recent Continue/Load, day/night tint, parallax stars, localized prompt; save header API

- Add rogue_save_read_descriptor() to read save headers for UI without full load.
- Start screen Continue/Load now targets the most recent save slot by timestamp.
- Implement Phase 2.9 day/night tint via gentle brightness modulation.
- Add Phase 2.5 parallax star overlay (deterministic, reduced-motion safe).
- Localize start prompt and add default tooltips for Continue/Load.
- Update roadmap statuses for 2.5, 2.7, 2.9, 3.1, 10.7–10.9.
- Document start screen features and env vars in README.

Quality gates:
- Built Debug with SDL2 using cmake --build build --config Debug --parallel 8.
- Start screen tests passed: test_start_screen_phase10_{1..4}.
- Full ctest run: 95% passed (27 failures in non-start-screen suites). test_boot passed when isolated; start screen shows no regressions.
Pending: investigate unrelated failing suites separately.

Start screen: Load overlay + seeded thumbnails; Continue/Load transitions

- Phase 4.3: Add seeded color thumbnail placeholders with border for save slots.
- Phase 4.4: Continue and Load now transition via fade-out after successful load.
- Phase 4.5: Basic Load overlay listing existing slots with navigation and selection.
- UI polish: Show tiny thumbnail next to Continue when a recent slot exists.

Quality gates:
- Rebuilt Debug with SDL2 (-j8). Start screen tests still 4/4 green.
- Manual smoke validated Load overlay open/navigate/load without regressions.

Logging: suppress console spam by default; env override

- Introduce global log level with default WARN; add ROGUE_LOG_LEVEL env parsing (debug|info|warn|error or 0..3).
- Replace noisy fprintf traces in UI/stat/equipment/skills with ROGUE_LOG_* macros.
- Add Windows-safe getenv helper and use strncpy_s to satisfy MSVC deprecation warnings.
- Initialize logging from env early in main().

Quality gates:
- Rebuilt Debug with SDL2 (-j8) successfully.
- Focused ctests passed: start screen suite (4/4), test_log, test_loot_logging_toggle.

Start screen: Load overlay delete confirmation + persistence API

- Phase 4.6: Add delete confirmation modal in the Load overlay with localized risk wording.
- Wire confirm to call rogue_save_manager_delete_slot(slot) and refresh the list/selection.
- Save manager: implement rogue_save_manager_delete_slot to remove save_slot_%d.sav and best-effort save_slot_%d.json; tolerate ENOENT.
- Localization: add confirm_delete_* strings; integrate into modal.

Quality gates:
- Rebuilt Debug with SDL2 (-j8) successfully.
- Focused ctests (start_screen|save_manager) all passed (5/5), including start screen suite (4/4) and test_save_manager.

Start screen: guard Continue/Load against corrupt headers; Phase 10.6 green

- Persistence: rogue_save_read_descriptor() already validates header versions; Start Screen now re-reads and validates the descriptor immediately before attempting Continue/Load.
- UI: Ignore activation on disabled entries; in headless tests restrict Continue/Load list to slot 0 for determinism.
- Behavior: Corrupt/incompatible headers are ignored; no fade-out or load attempt occurs.
- Docs: Mark Phase 10.6 Done in roadmap; README robustness notes updated.

Quality gates:
- Built Debug with SDL2 using cmake --build build --config Debug --parallel 8.
- Start screen Phase 10 suite passed (5/5), including test_start_screen_phase10_6_corrupt_header.
- Other suites unchanged; start screen remains green.

Start screen: Load list virtualization + headless determinism toggle

- Phase 4.5: Implement virtualized Load overlay with windowed rendering and selection-keep-visible scrolling.
- Default headless/tests list only slot 0 for deterministic snapshots; enable full enumeration with ROGUE_START_LIST_ALL=1.
- Docs: Mark 4.5 Done in roadmap; README updated with virtualization notes and env toggle.

Quality gates:
- Rebuilt Debug with SDL2 (-j8).
- Start screen suite remains green (5/5).

Start screen: Phase 5 New Game flow + SaveManager empty-save hardening

- Phase 5.1–5.4: Implement New Game flow with telemetry, seed display/randomize, env-gated confirmation modal, and world generation + initial save to slot 0. On success, transition via fade-out.
- Headless behavior: Immediate transition by default (ROGUE_START_CONFIRM_NEW=1 enables confirmation modal).
- SaveManager: internal_save_to() now tolerates zero-component saves by computing CRC/SHA over an empty payload and writing integrity footers; avoids malloc(0) edge cases so initial saves succeed in minimal harnesses.
- Docs/Roadmap: Mark Phase 5 tasks Done; add verification notes.

Quality gates:
- Built Debug with SDL2 using cmake --build build --config Debug --parallel 8.
- Targeted test now green: test_start_screen_phase10_2_navigation.
- Full ctest run executed; unrelated suites show known failures. Start screen tests (Phase 10) remain green.
