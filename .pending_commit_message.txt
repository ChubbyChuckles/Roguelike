feat(loot): implement advanced generation API (8.1, 8.3, 8.5) and tests

Adds new module loot_generation (context-driven item creation) including:
- Generation context struct (enemy level, biome, archetype, player luck)
- Seed mixing helper (8.5) for deterministic yet varied outputs
- Multi-pass rarity->item->affix flow (8.3) via existing roll_ex path
- Rarity floor influence from enemy level + global floor integration
- Hooks affix rolling into spawned instance

Introduces quality scalar config stub (future 8.4 work) and placeholder affix gating hook (8.2).

Adds unit test test_loot_phase8_generation_basic covering:
- Context-driven rarity floor
- Deterministic reproduction with same seed/context

Marks roadmap items 8.1, 8.3, 8.5 as Done in implementation_plan.txt.

Also integrates module into build system.
