Start Screen: Phase 3.3 tooltips + Phase 10.3/10.4 tests

- Added minimal localization module (core/localization.{h,c}) and integrated into build.
- Start screen now uses localized labels; added right-side tooltip panel with contextual hints.
- Implemented reduced-motion behavior to skip fade-in; toned down title pulse under reduced motion.
- New tests:
	- test_start_screen_phase10_3_localization (locale swap changes labels)
	- test_start_screen_phase10_4_reduced_motion (fades skipped, quick exit)
- Roadmap updated (3.3, 10.3, 10.4 marked Done). README to be updated with env ROGUE_REDUCED_MOTION.
