AI Phase 1.4–1.7: Scheduler accounting, deterministic RNG, trace buffer, path serialization

Summary:
* Extended BehaviorTree with tick counters & active path serialization helper.
* Added deterministic per-agent RNG (xorshift64*) `ai/core/ai_rng.h`.
* Implemented behavior trace ring buffer `ai/core/ai_trace.{c,h}` (stores tick index + path hash).
* Added preorder active path serializer + hashing in tests for replay/consistency groundwork.
* New unit test `test_ai_phase1_scheduler_trace` validating trace accumulation, path change hashing, and RNG determinism.
* Roadmap updated (1.4–1.7 marked Done) & README AI section expanded to reflect new capabilities.

Notes / Next Steps:
- Phase 2 blackboard extensions (vec2/entity_ref/timer + TTL / write policies).
- Utility selector implementation using scorer interface.
- Integrate BT into enemy update loop behind feature flag for incremental migration.

Testing:
- Both AI tests pass under Release build with SDL enabled (executed via ctest from build dir).
