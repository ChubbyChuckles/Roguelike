AI Phase 4 (Behavior Node Library partial): Added advanced node implementations (parallel composite, condition nodes: player visible / timer elapsed / health below, action nodes: move_to, flee_from, melee attack, ranged attack stub, decorators: cooldown + retry, utility selector with dynamic per-child scoring). Introduced new source `advanced_nodes.c/h`, integrated into build, and created unit test `test_ai_phase4_nodes` covering utility scoring selection, movement progression, and cooldown gating. Refactored behavior_tree vtable allocation to per-node heap instances, added centralized advanced node cleanup to avoid leaks, and resolved heap corruption by eliminating double destroys in tests and simplifying utility selector child management via existing add_child path. Updated AI roadmap (Phase 4 items marked Done/Partial with annotations) and README AI section to reflect new nodes and upcoming tactical work. All AI phase tests (1â€“4) pass.
