Character Progression Phase 12 Completion: Added V3 progression persistence (progression_persist.c/h)
- Version bump to 3 with new ProgHeaderV3 including attr_op_count and passive unlock list
- Passive unlock sparse list serialization (node_id,timestamp placeholder) with deterministic ordering
- Attribute operation journal (code,kind) persisted & replayed; migration flag ATTR_REPLAY
- Migration flags extended (TALENT_SCHEMA, ATTR_REPLAY); existing STAT_REG fingerprint check retained
- Backwards compatibility loader now supports V1, V2, V3 with replay and chain hash parity
- Added attribute journal infrastructure (ops array) & public accessors for persistence tests
- Extended tests: new test_progression_phase12_v3 validates roundtrip, replay counts (3 ops), chain hash stability
- Roadmap Phase 12.2â€“12.5 marked Done; README changelog updated
