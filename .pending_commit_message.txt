AI Phase 3 (Perception System): Implemented LOS, vision cone, hearing events, threat accumulation/decay, last-seen memory & group alert broadcast. Added `ai/perception/perception.{c,h}` with overridable blocking predicate for deterministic tests. Introduced global sound event ring (cap 32) and `RoguePerceptionAgent` struct (position, facing, threat, last_seen, TTL). Added unit test `test_ai_phase3_perception` validating: unobstructed vs blocked LOS, FOV inclusion/exclusion with facing changes, threat gain while visible & decay once out of sight, hearing-based threat & memory seeding, and group alert broadcast radius filtering. Updated CMakeLists, roadmap (Phase 3 items marked Done with annotations), and README AI section to reflect Phases 2 & 3 completion. Defined M_PI fallback for MSVC. Prepares groundwork for Phase 4 condition/action nodes and utility selector.
