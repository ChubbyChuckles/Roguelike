integration(sync v5.8): snapshot double-buffer, delta round-trip, rollback cursor; tests passing

– Snapshot Manager: introduce per-system double-buffered snapshots so prior snapshot pointers remain valid across subsequent capture; adjust dump and reset; keep version/hash/timestamp monotonic; fix replay helper for new layout.
– Delta Sync: byte-range delta builder/apply path validated; stats for generated/applied bytes; guards for version/system mismatches.
– Rollback Manager: expand max systems to 512; store FULL or DELTA entries vs latest FULL to save memory; add traversal cursor so step_back(1) returns latest and subsequent calls walk older entries; reset cursor on new captures; maintain detailed stats and event log.
– Tests (Phase 5.8): add and pass unit tests for snapshot consistency, delta correctness, transaction isolation/timeout/prepare-failure, rollback step semantics, and multi-system integration. All pass under MSVC warnings-as-errors.
– Docs/Roadmap: mark Phase 5.8 items Done; README changelog updated. Build remains SDL2 with parallel MSBuild (/m:8).

combat: fix familiarity progression test; suppress knockback in forced-attack harness; early hit-mask reset

– combat_strike: gate knockback position updates behind runtime rogue_force_attack_active to keep targets stationary in unit tests; preserves gameplay knockback normally.
– combat_strike: reset per-strike hit mask at function start when processed/emitted masks are zero to support direct strike invocation by tests.
– weapons: familiarity accrues per hit; 10% cap applied; validated against test_combat_phase7_familiarity_cap.

progression/skills (Phase 3.6): XP events, gating, maze thresholds, and effect scaling

– 3.6.1: Added rogue_award_xp(...) publisher for XP_GAINED; validated XP→LEVEL_UP flow.
– 3.6.2: Enforced first-unlock level gating (level >= 5*skill_strength) in rogue_skill_rank_up; emitted SKILL_UNLOCKED tunneling skill_id via payload.xp_gained.source_id. Test covers gating + event.
– 3.6.3: Passive unlocks now respect progression maze thresholds (level/STR/DEX/INT); fixed heap corruption by deferring meta allocation post-augmentation. Test now passes.
– 3.6.4: Implemented skill effect scaling: Fireball damage = base(3+2*rank) + FIRE_POWER synergy + INT bonus (0.25*total_intelligence). Cooldown respects effective CDR using progression soft/hard caps (maps from rating via stat cache effective %). Added unit test test_progression_phase3_6_effect_scaling printing PH3_6_EFFECT_SCALING_OK.
– Roadmap updated (3.6.1–3.6.4 -> Done); README changelog notes.
