Equipment System Phase 7.2–7.6: Defensive Layer Extensions Completed

Includes:
* 7.2 Damage Conversion: phys_conv_fire_pct/frost_pct/arcane_pct affix stats (enum, parser, aggregation) + melee damage conversion pipeline (95% cap, conservation) in combat_guard.
* 7.3 Guard Recovery: guard_recovery_pct affix scaling regen (multiplicative, clamp 0.1x–3x) and inversely scaling hold drain (floor 0.25x).
* 7.4 Reactive Shield Procs: Added absorb pool helpers (proc engine) + block event integration; melee pipeline consumes absorb before reflect; test ensures ordering & depletion.
* 7.5 Thorns / Reflect: thorns_percent & thorns_cap affix stats aggregated; reflect applied after conversion & absorb with per-hit cap.
* 7.6 Tests: Added / updated tests:
	- test_equipment_phase7_defensive (block chance/value)
	- test_equipment_phase7_block_affixes (block affix injection)
	- test_equipment_phase7_affix_parsing_newstats (new defensive affix parsing)
	- test_equipment_phase7_conversion_reflect (conversion conservation, over-cap, guard recovery scaling, reflect path)
	- test_equipment_phase7_reactive_shield (absorb ordering: block → conversion → absorb → reflect; depletion)

Implementation Notes:
* Ordering enforced inside combat_guard: passive/active block → conversion split & cap → reactive shield absorb consumption → reflect.
* Proc engine extended with absorb pool APIs (rogue_procs_absorb_pool, rogue_procs_consume_absorb, rogue_proc_force_activate).
* Affix CSV updated with embered, glacial, eldritch, of_resurgence, of_spines, of_rebuke.
* README section updated with Phase 7.2–7.5 summary and shield completion note.
* Roadmap updated: 7.2,7.3,7.4,7.5,7.6 all marked Done.

Quality:
* All new/modified tests build & pass (validated individually).
* SDL2 build configuration maintained; no linker regressions.

Next (future phases): Proceed to Phase 8 durability systems or begin Phase 8.1–8.3 slice with durability loss model + repair cost + UI thresholds.
