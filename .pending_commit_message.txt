Skills Phase 7.6 + Phase 8.1–8.4: central coefficients module, soft-cap clamp, and full proc tests

- Add centralized skill coefficients registry (src/core/skills/skills_coeffs.{h,c}) with base + per-rank scalar and STR/DEX/INT contributions (percent per 10).
- Integrate into runtime via skill_get_effective_coefficient; include in build.
- Enforce soft-cap using rogue_soft_cap_apply plus hard clamp to cap per stat to satisfy expected bounds under extreme stats.
- Unit tests: add/green test_skills_phase8_coeffs; ensure Phase 7 proc suite fully green (ICD, probability smoothing, loop guard, dynamic scaling, regression).
- Roadmap: mark Phase 7.6 and Phase 8.1–8.4 as Done.

Skillsystem Phase 7.4–7.5: Anti-proc loop guard + dynamic scaling; tests and docs

- Implement loop guard in skills procs: depth cap (8) and cycle signature hash to prevent cyclic proc storms; deterministic suppression with single warn-once overflow.
- Add dynamic proc scaling: per-proc recent-window chance reduction (~12% per extra recent trigger, capped at ~60%), integrated with existing deterministic RNG + optional smoothing.
- Unit test `tests/unit/test_skills_phase7_4_5_loop_and_scaling.c`: validates loop protection and scaling under bursty triggers; disables buff dampening for rapid stacking; assertions use `rogue_buffs_get_total`.
- Roadmap updated: mark 7.4/7.5 Done with details; README gains a subsection documenting safety and scaling behavior.
- All Phase 7 tests (7.1–7.5) pass locally in Debug with SDL2 and parallel runs (-j16).
