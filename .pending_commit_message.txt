feat(persistence): add JSON export & component reload utilities, endianness helper, restore basic manager test

Added debug/testing APIs: rogue_save_export_json for lightweight header+section listing and rogue_save_reload_component_from_slot to selectively reapply a single component payload without full reload. Introduced endian detection helper (rogue_save_format_endianness_is_le) and optional strict guard in load path. Implemented new unit tests (json_export, component_reload, basic save_manager smoke) and integrated them into CTest. Fixed missing test target registration and provided local buff stubs for isolated test linking. Roadmap updated marking Phase 3.2 and 3.3 items partial. README persistence section pending future full sectioned format + per-section integrity work.
