progression: Phase 3 Ratings & Diminishing Returns System

Added rating categories (crit/haste/avoidance) with multi-band diminishing returns curves and integration into combat strike & stat cache.

Details:
- progression_ratings.[ch] with rogue_rating_effective_percent / rogue_rating_apply_chain
- Player struct & persistence (CRIT_R/HASTE_R/AVOID_R)
- Stat cache raw & effective rating fields
- Combat crit chance includes rating (cap 80%)
- Unit test test_progression_phase3_ratings (monotonic, continuity, caps)
- Roadmap Phase 3 marked Done; README progression row updated

Verification: test passes (progression_phase3_ratings: OK) with SDL2 build.

progression: Phase 4 Maze Skill Graph Framework

Implemented progression maze wrapper (progression_maze.[ch]) layering metadata atop geometric skill maze:
- Node meta: ring-derived level & attribute requirements, point cost ramp, flags, adjacency indices.
- Procedural optional branch augmentation (~5% new leaves) & difficulty tagging for dense inner hubs.
- Shortest cost path utility (Dijkstra) and gating predicate API.
- Orphan audit & optional node counting.
- Unit test test_progression_phase4_maze (build, gating, path cost sanity, orphan audit) added to test suite.
- Roadmap Phase 4 marked Done; README progression row updated.

Verification: SDL2 build + test_progression_phase4_maze passes.

enemy_difficulty: Phase 5 AI Behavior Intensity Layers

Added AI intensity system introducing tiers (Passive, Standard, Aggressive, Frenzied) each with action frequency, movement speed, and attack cooldown multipliers. Implemented escalation logic (proximity, player low health threshold, recent pack member deaths) and de-escalation (calm drift toward baseline, high player health & distance decay) with hysteresis cooldown to prevent rapid oscillation. Integrated into spawn initialization, per-tick AI update (movement speed, animation pacing, attack cooldown calculation), and exposed profiles via `enemy_ai_intensity.[ch]`. Added unit test `test_enemy_difficulty_phase5` validating escalation to Frenzied and subsequent relaxation below Frenzied. Roadmap Phase 5 items (5.1â€“5.5) marked Done; README changelog updated.

Verification: SDL2 build; unit tests compiled including new test_enemy_difficulty_phase5 (passes locally).

vendor: Phase 0 Economic Baseline (Catalog + Value Model)

Implemented foundational vendor economy slice:
- econ_materials.[ch]: material/currency catalog builder (category + id heuristics) capturing base values (>=1) with query APIs.
- econ_value.[ch]: deterministic item valuation formula base_value * slot_factor * rarity_mult * (1 + p/(p+20)) * (0.4 + 0.6*durability) (clamped) with rarity ladder {1,3,9,27,81} and slot factors (weapon 1.4, armor 1.3, gem 1.2, consumable 0.8, material 1.0, misc 0.9).
- vendor.c integration: pricing now delegates to rogue_econ_item_value ensuring single source of truth.
- Unit test test_vendor_phase0_value: validates catalog population (arcane_dust, primal_shard present), rarity monotonicity, affix power monotonicity (DR curve), durability floor & ordering.
- Roadmap Phase 0 items 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5 marked Done; README changelog updated.

Verification: SDL2 build & test_vendor_phase0_value passes (valuation invariants OK).

vendor: Phase 0 Economic Baseline Completion (Inflow Simulation)

Added econ_inflow_sim.[ch] providing deterministic baseline inflow estimator (kills/min * hours * average item/material drops) computing expected counts & economic value using mean base values across loaded definitions + material catalog. Implemented unit test test_vendor_phase0_inflow validating parameter reflection, expected counts arithmetic, and positive total value composition. Updated roadmap (0.4 Done), README changelog appended, CMake lists include econ_inflow_sim and test target.

Verification: SDL2 build; tests test_vendor_phase0_value & test_vendor_phase0_inflow pass (vendor subset all green).
