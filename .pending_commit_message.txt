Phase 14 (Perf & Memory) – Initial Slice

Implemented performance foundation for equipment aggregation:
 - Added equipment_perf.c/h with SoA per-slot stat arrays and total accumulators (14.1 Done).
 - Added linear frame arena allocator (alloc/reset/high-water) (14.2 Partial – not yet widely adopted outside perf test).
 - Added pseudo-SIMD 4-slot batch aggregation path alongside scalar path; results parity validated (14.3 Done conceptually; real intrinsics deferred for portability).
 - Added lightweight micro-profiler (zone begin/end, stats dump) and instrumented aggregation variants (14.5 Done).
 - New test test_equipment_phase14_perf: spawns items, runs scalar then simd aggregation, asserts identical totals, profiler zone capture, arena bounds, and prints metrics (14.6 Done).
 - Roadmap updated (14.1, 14.3, 14.5, 14.6 Done; 14.2 Partial; 14.4 still X).
