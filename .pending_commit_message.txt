AI Phase 1.1–1.3: Behavior Tree & Blackboard scaffolding

Summary:
* Added ai/ module with core BT engine (behavior_tree.c,h) and linear typed blackboard (blackboard.c,h).
* Implemented basic composite & leaf nodes (Selector, Sequence, always success/failure, bool check condition).
* Introduced lightweight utility scorer interface (utility_scorer.h) for future dynamic utility selection.
* Integrated new sources into build; added explicit unit test (test_ai_behavior_tree) exercising blackboard & traversal.
* Updated AI roadmap marking 1.1–1.3 Done with implementation notes.
* README updated with new AI & Behaviour section summarizing Phase 1 progress and upcoming work.

Notes / Next Steps:
- Phase 1.4–1.7: scheduler, per-agent RNG, trace buffer, serialization pipeline.
- Phase 2: extend blackboard types (vec2, entity refs, timers + TTL/decay) and reactive invalidation.
- Later: integrate BT driving enemy_system_ai.c (currently still procedural) behind feature flag.

Testing:
- New unit test passes (Selector fallback path then conditional success scenario).
