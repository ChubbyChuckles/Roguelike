Equipment Phase 16.4: Runeword Recipe Validator

Summary:
- Implemented runeword pattern validation API `rogue_runeword_validate_pattern` (lowercase alphanumeric + single underscores, max 5 segments, length <=11, rejects empty / double underscore / invalid chars).
- Integrated validator into `rogue_runeword_register` (returns -3 when invalid) to prevent impossible or malformed patterns entering registry.
- Added comprehensive unit test `test_equipment_phase16_runeword_validator` covering failure cases (null, empty, uppercase, invalid symbol, segment overflow, double underscore) and success cases including max segment pattern; verifies registration rejection on invalid pattern.
- Updated roadmap marking Phase 16.4 Done with description.
- Minor: Added public prototype to `equipment_content.h`.

Rationale:
Prevents silent acceptance of malformed runeword recipes which would undermine deterministic matching & future crafting UI. Guarding early simplifies content tooling and future hotâ€‘reload diffing.

Testing:
New test passes (Release build) alongside existing Phase 16.x tests. No warnings introduced.
