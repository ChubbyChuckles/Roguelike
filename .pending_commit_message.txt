AI System Phase 11 (Testing & QA) Completion\n+\n+Added comprehensive test suite expansion for behaviour system quality gates:\n+- Core node & decorator edge coverage (`test_ai_phase11_core_nodes`): Selector/Sequence short-circuit, Parallel success/failure/running aggregation, Utility selector deterministic tie-break, cooldown boundary reset, retry exhaustion & reset.\n+- Blackboard fuzz harness (`test_ai_phase11_blackboard_fuzz`): 5k deterministic pseudo-random operations across Set/Max/Min/Accumulate + timers/vec2 ensuring policy invariants and capacity safety.\n+- Scenario script (`test_ai_phase11_scenario`): Patrol waypoint cycle -> visibility-triggered chase -> loss & patrol resume validating movement & branch selection transitions.\n+- Repro trace test (`test_ai_phase11_repro_trace`): Dual seeded RNG-branch trees produce identical active path serializations & hashes for 40 ticks; alternate seed diverges (determinism guard).\n+- Performance regression guard (`test_ai_phase11_perf_guard`): Simulated profiler frames below and above budget asserting accurate exceeded flag & agent counts.\n+\n+Roadmap updates: Phase 11.1â€“11.5 marked Done with descriptive annotations. README gains Phase 11 summary section under AI & Behaviour.\n+\n+These additions solidify baseline for forthcoming Movement & Pathing (Phase 5.x) and Combat Behaviour Extensions (Phase 6.x) by catching behavioural drift, policy regressions, or perf budget creep early.\n+
