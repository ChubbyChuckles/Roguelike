feat(loot/phase9): player preference learning (9.3) + adaptive integration

Adds pickup-driven preference learning atop adaptive balancing:
- Tracks per-category pickup counts (reset with adaptive reset)
- Computes mild inverse bias (clamped 0.75xâ€“1.25x, smoothed) so over-picked categories slightly de-prioritize
- Exposes API: rogue_adaptive_record_pickup + rogue_adaptive_get_category_preference_factor
- Integrated into pickup path (records on successful pickup) for passive learning

Testing:
- New test_loot_phase9_preference validates dampening behavior vs untouched category
- Existing adaptive + drop rate tests still pass

Docs & Plan:
- README deep dive & changelog updated with (9.3)
- implementation_plan.txt marks 9.3 Done

Next Steps (9.4+):
- Tie pity thresholds into adaptive factors (rare drought relief synergy)
- Add session metrics (9.5) + console tuning commands (9.6)
 - Integrate preference + adaptive factor product into loot table weighting hook
