Start screen: most-recent Continue/Load, day/night tint, parallax stars, localized prompt; save header API

- Add rogue_save_read_descriptor() to read save headers for UI without full load.
- Start screen Continue/Load now targets the most recent save slot by timestamp.
- Implement Phase 2.9 day/night tint via gentle brightness modulation.
- Add Phase 2.5 parallax star overlay (deterministic, reduced-motion safe).
- Localize start prompt and add default tooltips for Continue/Load.
- Update roadmap statuses for 2.5, 2.7, 2.9, 3.1, 10.7â€“10.9.
- Document start screen features and env vars in README.

Quality gates:
- Built Debug with SDL2 using cmake --build build --config Debug --parallel 8.
- Start screen tests passed: test_start_screen_phase10_{1..4}.
- Full ctest run: 95% passed (27 failures in non-start-screen suites). test_boot passed when isolated; start screen shows no regressions.
Pending: investigate unrelated failing suites separately.
