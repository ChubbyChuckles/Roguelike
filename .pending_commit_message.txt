combat: Phase 1A frame cache + overlapping windows + boundary tests & event consume API

Additions (Phase 1A focus):
 - Frame data cache (1A.1 complete): builds once for all authored attack windows; `rogue_attack_window_frame_span` now O(1) after init.
 - Overlapping multi-hit window authoring: heavy_2 windows adjusted (0-50, 40-80, 80-105) to exercise overlap semantics without duplicate damage.
 - New overlap/boundary test `test_combat_window_boundary` validating inclusive/exclusive edges and that only newly active windows apply damage at overlaps.
 - Event consumption API `rogue_combat_consume_events` (non-destructive) enabling future FX/SFX layers without corrupting multi-hit masks.
 - Extended test coverage: heavy multi-window (`test_combat_heavy_multi_window`), overlap boundary (`test_combat_window_boundary`), existing events test stabilized after API addition.

Fixes:
 - Removed mask reset in event consume (previous attempt could re-emit events / double-hit); resolved segfault in `test_combat_events`.

Documentation & Plan:
 - Updated implementation_plan_combatsystem.txt: 1A.1 & 1A.7 marked Done; notes on overlap test & frame cache.
 - README combat section expanded (overlap example, frame cache, consume API).

Quality Gates:
 - All new/modified combat tests pass (heavy_multi_window, window_boundary, events).
 - No regressions in existing multi-hit & combo scaling tests.

Next Steps:
 - Phase 2 damage type + mitigation pipeline (2.1â€“2.2) introduction.
 - FX/SFX dispatch consumer using event ring.
 - External attack data authoring tool (deferred) & status buildup application thresholds.
