UI Phase 4.9: Durability thresholds bar & warning icon

Summary:
- Added durability bar to equipment panel with color-coded buckets: green (>=60%), amber (30-59%), red (<30%).
- Added warning '!' overlay icon at critical (red) state for quick visual alert.
- Text color for durability line now matches bucket for consistent theming.
- Introduced helper `rogue_durability_bucket(pct)` (returns 2 good,1 warn,0 critical) for deterministic classification.
- Unit test `test_ui_phase4_durability_thresholds` validates bucket boundaries including clamp behavior outside 0..1 range.
- Roadmap updated marking Phase 4.9 Done; README updated with feature description.

Notes:
- Future enhancement: animate gradual color transition and integrate repair cost preview tooltip.

UI Phase 4.10: Controller-friendly radial selector menu

Summary:
- Added radial selector state to UI context (supports up to 12 wedges) with open/choose/cancel events.
- Implemented `rogue_ui_radial_open/close` and `rogue_ui_radial_menu` builder rendering wedge panels + labels around a center.
- Analog stick angle maps to wedge index (index 0 at Up, clockwise ordering). Keyboard arrows provide cycling fallback for KB users.
- Event kinds added: ROGUE_UI_EVENT_RADIAL_OPEN / _CHOOSE / _CANCEL.
- Unit test `test_ui_phase4_radial_selector` validates open event emission, axis-driven selection range, and choose event payload.
- Roadmap & README updated marking Phase 4.10 Done.

Notes:
- Future: add mouse-driven selection (hover sectors), visual wedge slice geometry, and cancel via right-click / B button.
