feat(ai): enemy BT feature flag integration + per-frame AI budget profiler (Phase 5 & 9.1)

Implemented Phase 5 initial enemy integration:
- Added per-enemy behavior tree enable/disable + simple MoveToPlayer tree (feature flag field on RogueEnemy)
- Conditional tick path in enemy_system_ai
- Unit test test_ai_phase5_enemy_integration (uses SDL_MAIN_HANDLED)

Resolved widespread duplicate symbol linker errors by removing local rogue_buffs_apply stubs from persistence tests (now rely on core buff system).

Implemented Phase 9.1 performance instrumentation:
- New ai/core/ai_profiler.{c,h}: budget setter, begin_frame, record_agent, snapshot (frame total, max agent, count, exceeded)
- Added test_ai_phase9_budget validating non-exceeded and exceeded budget behavior
- Updated AI roadmap marking 9.1 Done; README AI section documents profiler

Follow-up: Migration chain & metrics tests still simulate legacy header by manual version rewrite; future refinement may recompute descriptor checksum instead of triggering tamper (-7). No functional changes to save_manager in this slice.
