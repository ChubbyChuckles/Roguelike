Progression Phase 7 (Scaffold) – Added ring expansion milestones & keystone heuristic
Progression Phase 7 (Dynamic Expansion Completion)

Enhancements:
- Implemented full dynamic maze ring expansion API `rogue_progression_maze_expand` (procedural outer ring generation, node placement on radial bands, linkage to prior outer ring, full adjacency rebuild & meta refresh). Added helper `rogue_progression_maze_total_rings`.
- Integrated milestone logic + expansion in new unit test `test_progression_phase7_rings` (synthetic minimal maze -> validates milestone ring unlocks, keystone flag invariants, expansion adds >0 rings, ring count increases correctly, no optional/keystone overlap, keystone helper queries correct).
- Upgraded roadmap Phase 7: 7.1 & 7.2 marked Done (scaffold for keystone effects), 7.3 Partial (structural anti-stack guard), 7.5 Done initial; 7.4 pending (visualization layer).
- Cleaned test debug instrumentation; final test emits single success line.

Rationale:
- Provides concrete data structure growth path ahead of visualization & persistence integration.
- Establishes deterministic seed input for future replay & telemetry (seed parameter retained in API).

Follow-ups:
- Persist expanded rings & keystone selection in save snapshot.
- Data-driven keystone definitions + cost/prereq balancing coefficients.
- Integrate anti-stack synergy coefficients in stat aggregation (Phase 9/11) + UI ring layering (7.4).

Summary:
- Implemented Phase 7 groundwork: added ring expansion milestone function `rogue_progression_ring_expansions_unlocked` (+1 ring at level 50 then every 25 levels, capped at +4) to prepare for dynamic outer layer unlocks.
- Extended `progression_maze` meta flags (added bit2 keystone) and introduced constants (`ROGUE_MAZE_FLAG_*`).
- Keystone heuristic: high-degree (>=5) nodes in outer 30% of rings auto-flagged as provisional keystones; optional leaf nodes explicitly excluded.
- Added query helpers: `rogue_progression_maze_is_keystone`, `rogue_progression_maze_keystone_total`.
- Added scaffold test `test_progression_phase7_rings` verifying milestone ring unlock logic, keystone count non-negativity, and optional-keystone mutual exclusion.
- Updated roadmap Phase 7 items 7.1–7.3 & 7.5 to Partial with notes; visualization (7.4) remains unstarted.

Next Steps (future phases):
- Data-driven keystone definition & cost/prerequisite validation.
- Dynamic maze expansion structure allocation & persistence serialization.
- Anti-stack synergy coefficient integration into stat aggregation & passive application layers.
- UI layering & zoom integration (Phase 7.4) once dynamic expansion implemented.
