Equipment System Phase 2 â€“ Layered Stat Cache Affix Aggregation & Derived Metrics

Implemented features:
* Added new affix stat kinds: strength_flat, dexterity_flat, vitality_flat, intelligence_flat, armor_flat (parser + enum).
* Refactored equipment stat aggregation to populate g_player_stat_cache.affix_* layers instead of mutating player base stats.
* Extended stat cache structure with affix_armor_flat and preserved externally gathered affix_* values during layer recompute.
* Added derived metrics (dps_estimate, ehp_estimate, toughness_index, mobility_index, sustain_index placeholder) populated each update.
* Introduced soft cap helper (rogue_soft_cap_apply) with continuity & diminishing returns tests.
* Fingerprint hashing over layered + derived fields retained (determinism audit).
* New tests:
	- test_equipment_phase2_affix_layers (affix layer population, fingerprint mutation on affix change, equip ordering invariance)
	- test_equipment_phase2_stat_cache (layer integrity, fingerprint change on base stat mutation, soft cap curve + monotonic slope)
* Roadmap updated: Phase 2 items 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 marked Done (2.3 pending).
* README changelog updated with Phase 2 highlight summary.

Notes:
* Resist breakdown panel (2.3) remains unimplemented.
* Future phases will introduce implicit/base item modifiers and buff layers feeding existing cache structure without breaking fingerprint hashing.

Next steps:
1) Implement Phase 2.3 resist breakdown panel + data model.
2) Begin Phase 3 item_level + budget governance scaffolding.
3) Add additional tests for large multi-slot equip permutations (stress determinism hashing).
