Equipment System Phase 2 – Layered Stat Cache, Derived Metrics, and Resist Breakdown

Completed Features:
* 2.1 Layered stat cache (base/implicit/affix/buff) with affix layer population via equipment aggregation.
* 2.2 Derived metrics (DPS, EHP, toughness, mobility, sustain placeholder) fully computed each update.
* 2.4 Soft cap helper (rogue_soft_cap_apply) + monotonic diminishing returns tests.
* 2.5 Deterministic fingerprint hashing across layered + derived numeric fields.
* 2.6 Tests for layer integrity, ordering invariance, fingerprint mutation, soft cap curve & slope.
* 2.3 Resist breakdown: new resistance affix stats (physical, fire, cold, lightning, poison, status), aggregation into stat cache, soft + hard caps, and validation test.

Implementation Details:
* Added new affix stat enums: strength_flat, dexterity_flat, vitality_flat, intelligence_flat, armor_flat, and resist_* variants; parser updated accordingly.
* Refactored equipment aggregation to populate g_player_stat_cache.affix_* and resistance fields (no direct player stat mutation).
* Extended stat_cache: affix_armor_flat + per-resistance fields; compute_derived applies soft cap (75%) with diminishing (softness=0.65) and hard cap (90%).
* Fingerprint logic unchanged but automatically captures new fields (positioned before fingerprint member) ensuring determinism auditing includes resistance changes.
* New unit tests:
	- test_equipment_phase2_affix_layers: affix primary stats, armor, fingerprint mutation on affix change, equip ordering invariance.
	- test_equipment_phase2_stat_cache: base layer integrity, fingerprint change on base stat mutation, soft cap curve + monotonic slope.
	- test_equipment_phase2_resists: resistance aggregation, diminishing above soft cap, hard cap enforcement (e.g., 120% -> 90%).

Roadmap Updates:
* Phase 2 items 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 all marked Done.

Equipment System Phase 3 – Item Level & Power Budget Governance

Implemented Features:
* 3.1 Item level field added to `RogueItemInstance` (initialized to 1 on spawn).
* 3.2 Power budget formula: `budget = 20 + item_level*5 + rarity^2*10` (capped rarity range) via `rogue_budget_max`.
* 3.3 Budget enforcement during affix generation: post-roll clamp reduces larger affix first until within cap.
* 3.4 Validation API: `rogue_item_instance_validate_budget` returns 0 (ok) or negative on invalid / over-budget.
* 3.5 Upgrade API: `rogue_item_instance_upgrade_level` increases item_level and incrementally elevates affix values toward new cap deterministically.
* 3.6 Unit test `test_equipment_phase3_budget` covers under-cap validity, forced over-cap detection, and multi‑level upgrade progression staying within budget.

Technical Notes:
* Generation clamp chooses decrement target by comparing prefix vs suffix value (ties favor prefix) for deterministic convergence.
* Upgrade loop uses lightweight LCG step to choose which affix to increment when both present, maintaining reproducibility across builds.
* Validation integrates with prospective persistence/tooling to flag legacy over-budget artifacts.

Documentation & Roadmap:
* equipment roadmap (implementation_equipment_system.txt) Phase 3 entries marked Done (3.1–3.6).
* README updated with Equipment Phase 3 section summarizing formula, enforcement, and APIs.

Follow-Up Candidates:
* Add statistical distribution test ensuring average affix utilization fraction stays within target band after many upgrades.
* Extend budget to multi-affix (future multi-prefix/suffix) by proportional scaling rather than decrement loop.
* UI exposure of item level + budget utilization (progress bar) in equipment panel.

Equipment Roadmap Phase 3 Completed (implementation_equipment_system.txt):
* Marked 3.1–3.6 Done (item_level field, budget formula, generation clamp, validator, upgrade scaling, unit tests).
* Added affix roll post-processing clamp ensuring no over-budget instances persist.
* Updated README with Phase 3 section; roadmap updated to reflect completion.

Equipment System Phase 4.1 – Implicit Modifier Layer

Implemented Features:
* Added implicit stat fields to `RogueItemDef` (primary attributes, flat armor, six resistances) plus `set_id` groundwork.
* Parser extended to accept optional implicit columns after flags; backward compatible (missing fields default to zero).
* New aggregation path in `equipment_stats.c` populates `implicit_*` layer and augments resist/armor sums prior to stat cache recompute.
* `stat_cache.c` layering updated to preserve externally populated implicit values (no zeroing during compute_layers).
* Unit test `test_equipment_phase4_1_implicits` validates parsing, implicit aggregation correctness, equip ordering fingerprint invariance, and fingerprint mutation when new implicit stats introduced.

Roadmap Updates:
* Phase 4.1 marked Done.

Next Steps (Phase 4 continuation): implement unique item schema + hook dispatch (4.2), set bonuses & partial scaling (4.3/4.4), runeword recipe scaffold (4.5), and precedence rules (4.6) with comprehensive tests (4.7).
