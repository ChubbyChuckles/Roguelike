Equipment System Phase 7.2–7.5: Damage Conversion, Guard Recovery, Thorns

Summary:
* Added new affix stats & enum entries: phys_conv_fire_pct, phys_conv_frost_pct, phys_conv_arcane_pct, guard_recovery_pct, thorns_percent, thorns_cap.
* Parsing: extended affix CSV parser to recognize new identifiers.
* Aggregation: equipment_stat pass now sums conversion, guard recovery, and thorns into stat cache.
* Combat Logic: implemented physical → elemental conversion in melee damage pipeline with 95% cap & conservation; guard recovery modifier scales regen and inversely scales drain (clamped); thorns reflect applied post-conversion with per-hit cap.
* Tests: new test_equipment_phase7_conversion_reflect exercising conversion conservation (normal & over-cap), guard recovery scaling math, and reflect path (no attacker application yet). Existing block tests unchanged and still pass.
* Roadmap: Marked 7.2, 7.3, 7.5 Done; 7.4 deferred (reactive shield procs); 7.6 tests updated (partial – shield ordering pending 7.4).
* README: Added section summarizing Phase 7.2–7.5 defensive extensions and deferral note for reactive shield procs.

Notes / Next:
* Reactive shield procs (7.4) will introduce absorb pool field + proc hook on block/hit before final damage application.
* Subsequent test will validate ordering: block → conversion → absorb → reflect.

Quality: Build & all related unit tests pass (block, affix parsing, conversion/reflect). SDL2 build flag respected.

Additional Partial (7.4): Added absorb pool helper APIs (rogue_procs_absorb_pool / consume_absorb / force_activate) laying groundwork for reactive shield proc test in next slice (no affix or proc registration yet to keep scope minimal).
