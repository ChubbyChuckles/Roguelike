feat(loot/phase9): accelerated pity thresholds (9.4)

Implements dynamic pity acceleration:
- Adds adjustable acceleration flag and effective threshold queries
- Reduces epic / legendary pity thresholds by 25% once halfway point reached (bounded >=1)
- Integrates via rarity sample path (apply_pity) without altering existing tests

Testing:
- New test_loot_phase9_pity exercises accelerated epic threshold behavior
- All phase 9 tests pass (drop rates, adaptive, preference, pity)

Docs & Plan:
- README deep dive and changelog updated with (9.4)
- implementation_plan.txt marks 9.4 Done

Next (9.5 / 9.6): session metrics (items/hour, rarity/hour) + console tuning commands (expose get/set for drop rates, adaptive reset, pity accel toggle)
