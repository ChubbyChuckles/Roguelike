Integration Phase 3.6.6–3.6.7: Add specialization subsystem and integrate into damage/cooldown

- Implemented progression_specialization module (C, no C++) with per-skill path selection: POWER (+10% damage) and CONTROL (−10% cooldown)
- Public APIs: init/shutdown, choose/get/respec, damage_scalar(), cooldown_scalar(); respec consumes attribute respec tokens
- Integrated specialization scalars in damage_calc for Fireball damage and cooldown paths alongside synergy, INT scaling, and mastery
- Added unit test test_progression_phase3_6_specialization validating baseline → POWER damage increase, respec token consumption, CONTROL cooldown reduction; success token PH3_6_SPECIALIZATION_OK
- Wired new module and test into CMake; built with SDL2 and parallelism (-j8)
- Updated roadmap (3.6.6–3.6.7) and README changelog
