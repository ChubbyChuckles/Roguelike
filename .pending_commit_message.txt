feat(itemsys/phase17): profiling timers + hash index for item defs

Phase 17 advancements:
 - 17.3 Profiling harness: Added high-resolution nanosecond timers capturing total time spent in affix roll sections and weight summations. New metrics fields: weight_sum_time_ns, affix_roll_time_ns. Public APIs rogue_loot_perf_affix_roll_begin/end guard roll scope.
 - 17.4 Cache-friendly indexing: Introduced open-addressed FNV-1a hash index for item definition id -> index lookups (rogue_item_defs_build_index / rogue_item_def_index_fast). Auto rebuild after item def loads; fast path falls back to linear scan on miss ensuring safety.
 - Added unit test test_loot_phase17_index verifying index build, hit/miss behavior, and parity with legacy lookup. Existing perf test unchanged.
 - Windows high-resolution timing fix: include <windows.h>, correct QueryPerformance* usage, and add <emmintrin.h> for SSE2 intrinsics.
 - Safety fix: rogue_loot_perf_get now guards NULL pointer (previous potential null deref).
 - Roadmap updated (17.3 & 17.4 Done; 17.5 In Implementation). README Phase 17 entry expanded to reflect new capabilities.

Follow-up (17.5 remaining): fine-grained per-item record diff emission within inventory section to avoid rewriting unchanged records during incremental save mode.
