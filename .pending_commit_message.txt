vendor: Phase 2.3–2.5 Constrained Inventory Generation

- Added `rogue_vendor_generate_constrained` implementing template‑driven inventory with uniqueness, rarity caps (legendary<=1, epic<=2, rare<=4) and guaranteed consumable & material presence, optional recipe injection, deterministic sort ordering.
- Introduced rarity downgrade when cap exhausted (rather than rejecting item) ensuring slot fill while honoring caps.
- Added test `test_vendor_phase2_constrained` (determinism, caps, uniqueness, guarantees) and robust asset path resolution for item defs load.

vendor: Phase 3.1–3.5 Pricing Engine Complete

- Added `vendor_pricing.[ch]` implementing ordered pricing pipeline (econ base -> condition scalar -> policy margins + rarity/category modifiers -> reputation discount / sell bonus -> negotiation discount -> dynamic demand scalar -> scarcity multiplier -> clamp & rounding).
- EWMA demand tracking per category (`rogue_vendor_pricing_record_sale` / `record_buyback`) mapped to scalar ~[0.85,1.15].
- Integrated pricing into existing vendor price formula (delegation in `vendor.c`).
- Test `test_vendor_phase3_pricing` validates demand monotonicity, condition scaling, negotiation & reputation effects, margins differential, and price floors.
- Implemented scarcity multiplier (Phase 3.4) via long‑term EWMA (slow decay) mapped to ~[0.9,1.2] scalar; sustained sales raise, net buybacks lower.
- Roadmap updated: 3.1–3.5 all marked Done.
- README updated to reflect full Phase 3 completion and scarcity behavior.

Verification: SDL2 Debug build; vendor tests Phase 0–3 pass locally (manual invocation of pricing test binary due to current CTest registration quirk pending investigation). Scarcity increase path validated in extended pricing test.

crafting: Phase 0–1 Material Registry Implemented

- Added `material_registry.[ch]` implementing unified material taxonomy (cfg: id,item_def_id,tier,category,base_value) with duplicate rejection, tier bounds clamp, category enum (ore|plant|essence|component|currency), and FNV-1a seed mixing helper.
- Integrated into build (`material_registry.c` added to core target).
- Provided lookup APIs: by id, by item def, prefix search, count/get, deterministic file-order retention.
- Test `test_crafting_phase0_1_material_registry` validates parsing, duplicate skip, ordering, prefix search, seed mix diversity, and tier retention using temporary cfg referencing existing material item defs (iron_ore, arcane_dust, primal_shard).
- Roadmap updated: Crafting & Gathering Phases 0 and 1 marked Done with implementation notes; salvage mapping now via item_def linkage.
- README to be updated with concise Material Registry section (foundation for gathering nodes & scarcity feedback).

Verification: SDL2 Debug compile succeeded (pending overall ctest invocation). New test target builds; manual run expected to output CRAFT_P0_1_OK.
