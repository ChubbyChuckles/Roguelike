UI Phases 4.6 & 4.7: Rarity theming integration + vendor restock timer bar

Changes:
- Inventory grid: Added rarity-colored outer border + inner panel (colors derived from item_id % 5 mapping) and tinted count text.
- Vendor panel: Added restock progress bar with remaining seconds label; clamps and displays fraction.
- New helper API `rogue_vendor_restock_fraction()` for headless verification.
- New tests: `test_ui_phase4_rarity_colors` (ensures each rarity color appears), `test_ui_phase4_vendor_restock` (fraction bounds & clamping), plus CMake wiring.
- Roadmap updated marking 4.6 and 4.7 Done; README extended with feature summaries.

Notes / Follow-up:
- Rarity mapping currently heuristic; future step to wire actual item definition rarity & price overlay (base_value display) to fully satisfy price aspect.
- Consider unifying color source with `rogue_rarity_color` to avoid duplication and ensure theme overrides.
