AI Phase 4 (Action & Tactical Expansion): Completed action node set (added Strafe action with alternating lateral direction). Implemented initial tactical nodes: FlankAttempt (perpendicular offset flank point generation), Regroup (movement toward regroup point until within radius), CoverSeek stub (flag set). Added unit test `test_ai_phase4_tactical` covering strafe timing & direction flip, flank point write, regroup completion, and cover flag. Updated `advanced_nodes.c/h` with new node implementations and prototypes. Registered new test in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`; all AI Phase 4 tests (`test_ai_phase4_nodes`, `test_ai_phase4_tactical`) pass along with earlier phases. Roadmap updated: Phase 4.3 marked Done; Phase 4.4 Partial; README AI section updated to reflect full action set and partial tactical implementation. Next steps noted (cover environment query, retry decorator test, enemy integration).
