Itemsystem Phase 18.3/18.4/18.5: Advanced loot analytics features
Itemsystem Phase 19.1: Per-rarity pickup sounds mapping
- Added rarity->pickup sound id storage (strings) with APIs rogue_rarity_set_pickup_sound / rogue_rarity_get_pickup_sound alongside existing spawn sound mapping.
- Integrated pickup sound lookup into loot pickup loop; logs chosen sound id (audio playback stub for now) preserving deterministic behavior.
- Added unit test test_loot_phase19_1_pickup_sounds verifying spawn, pickup deactivation, and absence of crash with configured pickup sounds.
- Updated roadmap (19.1 Done) and README with Phase 19.1 feature summary.
