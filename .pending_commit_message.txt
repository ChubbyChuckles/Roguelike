Progression Phase 7 (Scaffold) – Added ring expansion milestones & keystone heuristic

Summary:
- Implemented Phase 7 groundwork: added ring expansion milestone function `rogue_progression_ring_expansions_unlocked` (+1 ring at level 50 then every 25 levels, capped at +4) to prepare for dynamic outer layer unlocks.
- Extended `progression_maze` meta flags (added bit2 keystone) and introduced constants (`ROGUE_MAZE_FLAG_*`).
- Keystone heuristic: high-degree (>=5) nodes in outer 30% of rings auto-flagged as provisional keystones; optional leaf nodes explicitly excluded.
- Added query helpers: `rogue_progression_maze_is_keystone`, `rogue_progression_maze_keystone_total`.
- Added scaffold test `test_progression_phase7_rings` verifying milestone ring unlock logic, keystone count non-negativity, and optional-keystone mutual exclusion.
- Updated roadmap Phase 7 items 7.1–7.3 & 7.5 to Partial with notes; visualization (7.4) remains unstarted.

Next Steps (future phases):
- Data-driven keystone definition & cost/prerequisite validation.
- Dynamic maze expansion structure allocation & persistence serialization.
- Anti-stack synergy coefficient integration into stat aggregation & passive application layers.
- UI layering & zoom integration (Phase 7.4) once dynamic expansion implemented.
