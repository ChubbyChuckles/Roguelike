Equipment System Phase 1.2-1.4 - Slot Expansion & Two-Hand Flag
 - Expanded slots (weapon, offhand, head, chest, legs, hands, feet, ring1, ring2, amulet, belt, cloak, charm1, charm2).
 - Added OFFHAND slot plus two-handed flag (ROGUE_ITEM_FLAG_TWO_HANDED) in item definitions and parsing (optional flags column).
 - Enforced occupancy: equipping two-handed weapon auto-clears OFFHAND; OFFHAND equip blocked while two-handed weapon active.
 - Updated save_manager to serialize expanded slot set (count + per-slot instance indices) with backward-compatible loader.

Equipment System Phase 1.5 - Cosmetic Transmog Layer
 - Implemented per-slot cosmetic transmog override API (rogue_equip_set_transmog / rogue_equip_get_transmog).
 - Category validation ensures visual override shares category with target slot.
 - Added unit test test_equipment_phase1_transmog covering set, mismatch reject, clear.
 - Roadmap updated: 1.5 & 1.6 marked Done; 1.7 tests previously partial.
 - README updated with Phase 1 progress summary and transmog note.

Equipment System Phase 1.7 - Atomicity & Persistence Tests
 - Added test_equipment_items.cfg with greatsword (two-handed flagged) and shield.
 - New unit test test_equipment_phase1_persistence validates:
	 * Two-handed equip auto-clears OFFHAND & blocks shield.
	 * Swapping to one-hand weapon permits OFFHAND equip.
	 * Save/load roundtrip restores equipped instance indices (weapon, ring) verifying persistence.
 - CMake updated with test_equipment_phase1_persistence target.
 - Roadmap updated marking 1.7 Done (atomicity + persistence complete).
 - README will note Phase 1 completion status (1.1-1.7 Done).
