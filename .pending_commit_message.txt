Audio/VFX Phase 1.5: frame compaction + tests

- Implemented frame-level compaction in FX dispatcher: identical events by key (type, priority, id) are merged with a 'repeats' count.
- Digest now mixes repeat count to keep replay hash stable while reflecting merged intensity.
- Audio dispatch scales simple gain by repeats with soft clip; guarded for SDL_mixer presence.
- Added tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase1_5_compaction.c and registered both FX tests with CTest.
- Updated roadmap (1.5 Done) and kept docs/README in sync.

Audio/VFX Phase 1-2: add minimal event bus, audio registry, and LEVELUP cue routing

- Implement Phase 1 core event system:
  - Define RogueEffectEvent (type, priority, payload id, timing fields).
  - Double-buffered global FX queue with deterministic (priority, seq) ordering.
  - Submission API rogue_fx_emit + per-frame begin/end hooks and stable frame digest.
- Implement Phase 2.1 audio registry with SDL_mixer-backed Mix_Chunk loading.
  - Register LEVELUP sound from assets/sounds.cfg and enable id-based playback.
- Integrate bus into app_step: begin/end each frame and dispatch before present.
- Route level-up sound through FX bus from player_progress.
- Add unit test (test_audio_vfx_phase1_2) for ordering and digest determinism.
- CMake: include src/audio_vfx/effects.c and new test target.

Roadmap updates:
- Mark 1.1–1.3 Done, 1.4 Partial; 2.1 Done (minimal). Add notes and next actions.skills: talents v2 serialization (varint ranks, v1 back-compat) + deterministic hash incl. ranks; add unit test

Details:
- Implemented header v2 with unlocked bitset + varint ranks; v1 load maps unlocked→rank=1.
- Hash now folds version marker and non-zero ranks; stable independent of unlock order.
- Added test `test_talents_phase1b_ranks_and_hash`; all talents tests pass.
- Built Debug with SDL2 and parallelism (-j8).

Audio/VFX Phase 2.2–2.7: mixer, positional, variation, voice cap + tests

- Implemented audio mixer: master gain, per-category gains, and global mute; exposed getters/setters.
- Added positional attenuation stub: listener position, enable toggle, linear falloff radius; math validated via test helper.
- Deterministic variation selection (xorshift32 seeded with frame index + seq) and simple voice cap guard in dispatcher.
- Audio registry helpers (get_path, clear) and pure-function `rogue_audio_debug_effective_gain` for headless tests.
- Unit tests added: test_audio_vfx_phase2_2_mixer_gain, test_audio_vfx_phase2_3_mute, test_audio_vfx_phase2_6_positional, test_audio_vfx_phase2_1_registry_clear. All pass.
- Updated roadmap (Phase 2.2–2.7 Done) and README changelog.
- Built Debug with SDL2 and parallelism (-j8); ran focused CTest -R audio_vfx → 6/6 pass.

Audio/VFX Phase 3.1: VFX foundations (registry, pooled instances, time controls) + test

- Implemented minimal VFX subsystem in src/audio_vfx/effects.[ch]:
  - VFX registry (id -> {layer, world_space, lifetime_ms}) with clear/get helpers.
  - Active instance pool (cap 256) with per-layer counts and debug peek-first helper.
  - Time controls: global timescale scalar and freeze toggle applied during update aging; expired instances recycled.
  - Public spawn API (rogue_vfx_spawn_by_id) and dispatcher integration for ROGUE_FX_VFX_SPAWN.
- Added unit test tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase3_1_vfx_foundations.c exercising spawn via FX event, counts, peek helper, freeze & timescale behavior, and expiry; registered target in CMake.
- Build: Debug with SDL2 using parallelism (-j8) succeeds; CTest filtered -R audio_vfx passes 7/7.
- Documentation: Updated roadmap (3.1 Done; 3.3/3.4/3.6 Partial; 3.5 Done) and README changelog with Phase 3.1 entry.
