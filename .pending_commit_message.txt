Equipment Phase 7.1: Block Chance & Block Value Implementation\n\n- Added new defensive affix stats: block_chance, block_value (enum extensions in loot_affixes.h, parser updates in loot_affixes.c).\n- Extended stat cache (previous commit) now wired: equipment aggregation collects block stats from affixes.\n- Added passive block logic to combat_guard.c (roll vs aggregated block_chance even when not guarding; flat reduction by block_value).\n- Introduced new affix definitions in assets/affixes.cfg (bulwark / of_guarding) for block stats.\n- New tests: \n  * test_equipment_phase7_defensive validates passive block reduction path.\n  * test_equipment_phase7_block_affixes validates affix parsing & stat cache injection of block stats.\n- Roadmap updated marking Phase 7.1 Done.\n- README to be updated in subsequent phase batch (will summarize defensive extensions after 7.2â€“7.5).\n\nRationale: Establishes first defensive layer extension enabling subsequent phases (damage conversion, guard recovery, reactive shields, thorns) to integrate with a proven aggregation + combat application pattern.\n\n---\n\n
