Persistence: Phase 4.1 Integrity Hardening (v7)
 - Bump ROGUE_SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION to 7
 - Added per-section CRC32 (uncompressed payload) appended after each section in v7
 - Added overall SHA256 footer (magic SH32 + 32 bytes) covering all post-header bytes pre-footer
 - Implemented minimal SHA256 (no external deps) and exposed APIs: rogue_save_last_sha256(), rogue_save_last_sha256_hex()
 - Writer now computes section CRCs and final digest; loader validates descriptor checksum, per-section CRCs, and footer digest
 - Added new error codes: ROGUE_SAVE_ERR_SECTION_CRC, ROGUE_SAVE_ERR_SHA256
 - Added migration stub v6->v7 (no data transform required)
 - Added unit test test_save_v7_integrity (verifies digest stability, iteration under new layout, hex helper)
 - Updated roadmap (Phase 4.1 Done) and README persistence section (v7 integrity)
