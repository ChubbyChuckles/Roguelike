feat(loot/phase9): implement adaptive weighting engine (9.2)

Adds adaptive balancing layer:
- Tracks observed counts per rarity & per item category since reset
- Computes target uniform average and derives corrective factor = clamp(target/actual, 0.5x..2.0x)
- Applies exponential smoothing (25%) to avoid oscillation & thrash
- Exposes API (reset, record, recompute, get factors) in new loot_adaptive module
- Integrates via public factors callable by generation weighting logic (future hook for preference & pity synergy)
 - Unit test currently exercises category factors; rarity factors present for future 9.4 extension

Testing:
- New unit test test_loot_phase9_adaptive validates factor behavior under balanced, skewed, and rebalanced scenarios
- Ensures underrepresented category factor rises >1 while overrepresented drops < previous

Documentation:
- README deep dive updated with (9.2) description
- Changelog augmented with adaptive weighting entry
- Roadmap (implementation_plan.txt) marks 9.2 as Done

Notes / Next Steps:
- 9.3 will extend by layering player pickup preference bias on top of adaptive base
- Potential future improvement: sliding window (current implementation accumulative) and integration into rarity dynamic chain
