UI Phase 4.9: Durability thresholds bar & warning icon

Summary:
- Added durability bar to equipment panel with color-coded buckets: green (>=60%), amber (30-59%), red (<30%).
- Added warning '!' overlay icon at critical (red) state for quick visual alert.
- Text color for durability line now matches bucket for consistent theming.
- Introduced helper `rogue_durability_bucket(pct)` (returns 2 good,1 warn,0 critical) for deterministic classification.
- Unit test `test_ui_phase4_durability_thresholds` validates bucket boundaries including clamp behavior outside 0..1 range.
- Roadmap updated marking Phase 4.9 Done; README updated with feature description.

Notes:
- Future enhancement: animate gradual color transition and integrate repair cost preview tooltip.
