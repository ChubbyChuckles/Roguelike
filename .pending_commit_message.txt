Character Progression Phase 12 Completion: Added V3 progression persistence (progression_persist.c/h)
- Version bump to 3 with new ProgHeaderV3 including attr_op_count and passive unlock list
- Passive unlock sparse list serialization (node_id,timestamp placeholder) with deterministic ordering
- Attribute operation journal (code,kind) persisted & replayed; migration flag ATTR_REPLAY
- Migration flags extended (TALENT_SCHEMA, ATTR_REPLAY); existing STAT_REG fingerprint check retained
- Backwards compatibility loader now supports V1, V2, V3 with replay and chain hash parity
- Added attribute journal infrastructure (ops array) & public accessors for persistence tests
- Extended tests: new test_progression_phase12_v3 validates roundtrip, replay counts (3 ops), chain hash stability
- Roadmap Phase 12.2–12.5 marked Done; README changelog updated

Vendor System Phase 4 Completion: Reputation & Negotiation Implementation
- Added vendor_reputation.c/h module providing per-vendor reputation tracking with diminishing returns (logistic scaling)
- Reputation gain API (rogue_vendor_rep_gain) and raw adjust for penalties; progress & tier query helpers
- Deterministic negotiation attempt (rogue_vendor_attempt_negotiation) using attribute-derived skill tag scores (insight->intelligence, finesse->dexterity) + d20 style roll
- Success yields uniform discount within rule range, small rep gain, short lockout (5s); failure applies rep penalty (-1), longer lockout (10s)
- Added Phase 4 unit test (test_vendor_phase4_reputation_negotiation) verifying diminishing rep deltas and increased negotiation success with higher attributes
- Updated CMake to compile vendor_reputation module & register new test; roadmap Phase 4 entries marked Done

Vendor System Phase 5 Completion: Buyback & Transaction Journaling
- Added vendor_buyback.c/h implementing per-vendor circular buyback buffer (cap 32) storing item guid, def index, rarity, category, condition pct, original price, sell & assimilation timestamps.
- Depreciation model: 10% price decay per minute (discrete intervals) to 50% floor of original vendor payout; query API returns current depreciated resale price.
- Assimilation: entries auto-expire after 5 minutes (currently marked inactive placeholder for future stock merge in Phase 6+).
- Transaction journal vendor_tx_journal.c/h: FNV1a hash-chained append-only log (sale=1, buyback=2, future assimilate=3) capturing sequence id, synthetic timestamp, vendor id, action, guid low32, price, rep delta, discount pct; accum hash accessor for integrity.
- Anti-duplicate GUID lineage: recent GUID ring buffer (128) with lookup to detect repeat resale exploit attempts; exposed rogue_vendor_buyback_guid_recent.
- Unit test test_vendor_phase5_buyback_journal validates: ring buffer wrap (no crash, bounded count), monotonic depreciation (p0>=p1>=p2 & floor respected), journal hash determinism (two identical sequences -> same accum hash), duplicate guid detection returns flagged state on repeat.
- Integrated new sources into core CMake target & added test target (SDL2 linked if available). Roadmap Phase 5.1–5.5 marked Done; README changelog updated.

Vendor System Phase 6 Completion: Special Offers & Rotations
- Added vendor_special_offers.c/h providing up to 4 concurrent time-limited special offers (10 min duration) with compaction & expiry handling.
- Scarcity weighting: heuristic selects lowest base_value material (proxy deficit) for elevated inclusion probability; flag stored on offer.
- Nemesis performance tie-in: nemesis_defeated flag biases roll (25% branch) toward high-rarity blueprint injection (rarity forced 4) with origin flag.
- Pity timer: tracks consecutive roll cycles producing zero new offers; after threshold (3) guarantees a scarcity offer if available.
- Deterministic seed mixing uses world seed, nemesis flag salt, and prior roll seed for reproducibility.
- Unit test test_vendor_phase6_special_offers validates: offer accumulation, expiry compaction, nemesis rare occurrence, slot bounds, and prints VENDOR_PHASE6_SPECIAL_OFFERS_OK.
- Roadmap Phase 6.1–6.5 marked Done; README updated; CMake includes new module & test target.

Vendor System Phase 7 Completion: Currency & Sink Mechanics
- Added vendor_sinks.c/h module introducing sink category tracking (repair, upgrade, trade-in, fees) with cumulative counters and grand total API.
- Implemented upgrade service API rogue_vendor_upgrade_reroll_affix supporting single or dual affix reroll (dual consumes catalyst) with gold fee scaling by player level (base 40+rarity*60 scaled by 1+0.015*level; dual cost *1.75).
- Implemented material trade-in API rogue_vendor_material_trade_in converting surplus low-tier materials to higher-tier at unfavorable 6:1 ratio plus gold fee proportional to source material base value and level scaling.
- Fee scaling helper scale_fee(base,level) (linear factor) provides early inflation counter hook tied to progression.
- Added unit test test_vendor_phase7_sinks exercising upgrade reroll (fee + sink accumulation) and trade-in path (conversion, fee) producing VENDOR_PHASE7_SINKS_OK.
- Updated core & tests CMake (added vendor_sinks.c and test target), roadmap Phase 7.1–7.5 entries marked Done with notes, README changelog appended.
