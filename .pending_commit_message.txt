UI Phase 8 Animation & Timelines:
- Added easing library (cubic in/out/in-out, spring, elastic-out)
- Implemented entrance/exit transitions (scale & alpha) + exit completion tracking list
- Added button press spring pulse micro-interaction
- Added global animation time scale control
- Introduced timeline/keyframe system (scale & alpha channels) with REPLACE/IGNORE policies
- Added timeline sampling APIs (rogue_ui_timeline_scale/alpha) + unit test test_ui_phase8_timeline
- Integrated animation master step into frame begin (time-scaled)
- Reduced motion mode now shortens entrance/exit durations (25%)
- Updated roadmap Phase 8 statuses to Done

UI Phase 9 Performance & Virtualization (Partial):
- Added virtual list range + emission helpers (large list virtualization groundwork)
- Added dirty rectangle union tracking (changed flag + rect + node count)
- Added performance timing fields (frame/update/render) + budget check API
