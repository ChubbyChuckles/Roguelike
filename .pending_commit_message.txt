World Generation Phases 1-8 Implementation Summary

Phase 1 (Foundation): Added WorldGenConfig, multi-channel deterministic RNG (macro/biome/micro), chunk coord utilities, FNV-1a hash for golden snapshots, and unit test validating RNG independence and mapping correctness.

Phase 2 (Macro Layout): Implemented continent mask (fbm + radial falloff + adaptive land ratio balancing), elevation normalization, climate approximation (temperature + moisture), river downhill tracing, biome classification, and unit test asserting land ratio bounds, river reaches water, biome histogram determinism.

Phase 3 (Biome Descriptors & Registry): Added CFG-based biome descriptor parser (tile_* weights, densities, ambient color, music, feature flags), registry loader (directory scan + validation + normalization), palette blending, and unit test covering parse success/failure, normalization, blend output.

Phase 4 (Local Terrain & Caves): Introduced micro-scale perturbation, cave cellular automata, lava pockets, ore vein carving, passability map derivation, new tiles (LAVA, ORE_VEIN), and unit test verifying openness bounds, feature presence, passability determinism.

Phase 5 (Rivers & Erosion Detailing): Added river refinement (widening -> RIVER_WIDE, deltas), simplified thermal + hydraulic erosion passes, bridge hint gap scanner (BRIDGE_HINT enum), and unit test ensuring widened/delta presence, deterministic hash, non-zero bridge hint count.

Phase 6 (Structures & POIs): Structure descriptor registry (hut, watchtower, shrine) with footprint/biome/elevation/rarity fields, placement solver (spacing + constraints) carving STRUCTURE_WALL/FLOOR, dungeon entrance placement (DUNGEON_ENTRANCE), unit test for non-overlap & determinism. Roadmap & README updated.

Phase 7 (Dungeon Generator): Graph-based dungeon layer: stochastic non-overlapping rooms, nearest-neighbor MST + loop edges, corridor carving (DUNGEON_WALL/FLOOR), thematic tagging (largest=TREASURE, farthest two=ELITE, small leaf=PUZZLE), secret rooms (SECRET_DOOR), key/lock progression (LOCKED_DOOR + KEY), trap placement (TRAP). Unit test validates reachability, loop ratio, carving >0, deterministic regeneration, tagging invariants. README & roadmap updated (7.3 Done).

Phase 8 (Fauna & Spawn Ecology): Added spawn table registry (tile-type keyed) with normal/rare weights, density map (tile base + water adjacency dampening), hub suppression (radius zero + falloff), rare encounter roll (basis points) switching to alternate weight set, sampling API returning deterministic spawn id + rare flag. Unit test validates density build, non-zero sampling, determinism of first 20 ids, and suppression application. README & roadmap updated (Phase 8 Done).
Phase 9 (Resource Nodes): Added resource node descriptor registry (rarity, tool tier, yield range, biome mask), deterministic clustered placement algorithm with homogeneous biome clusters, rarity-tier upgrade roll (5/10/18% => 1.5x yield), generation API producing placements (x,y,desc_index,yield,upgrade), and unit test verifying non-zero nodes, deterministic regeneration (positions + desc indices), and upgrade count non-negative. Roadmap updated (Phase 9 items Done / respawn scheduling deferred), README extended with Phase 9 section.
Phase 10 (Weather & Environmental Simulation): Implemented weather pattern descriptor & registry (id, duration min/max, intensity range, biome mask, base weight), deterministic biome-weighted scheduler (macro RNG for pattern selection, micro RNG for intensity target), easing-based intensity transitions with fade-out, environmental effect hooks (lighting tint darken + blue shift, movement debuff factor), and unit test (`test_worldgen_phase10_weather`) simulating 2000 ticks asserting transitions occur, probability weighting (rain >= clear observations given weight advantage), and full determinism of per-pattern observation distribution across repeated seed runs. Roadmap & README updated with Phase 10 section.
Phase 11 (Runtime Streaming & Caching): Added chunk streaming manager (`world_gen_stream.c`) with ring-buffer async queue, per-tick generation budget, deterministic per-chunk seed derivation, LRU eviction policy (access tick based), stats tracking (hits/misses/evictions), and hash exposure for validation. Unit test `test_worldgen_phase11_streaming` enqueues > capacity, advances updates to fill cache, triggers eviction via new request, asserts cache misses >0, and validates deterministic chunk hash across manager recreation. Persistent on-disk caching interface flag present but serialization deferred (marked Partial in roadmap). Roadmap & README updated with Phase 11 section.
Phase 12 (Telemetry & Analytics): Added `world_gen_telemetry.c` with metrics snapshot struct (timing placeholders + counts), anomaly detection (land ratio bounds, missing rivers), heatmap export (biome tile ids), and helper to stringify anomaly list. Unit test `test_worldgen_phase12_telemetry` validates metrics collection, anomaly flag behavior, deterministic heatmap reproduction across runs. Roadmap marked Phase 12 items Done (structure density & timing instrumentation deferred), README updated with Phase 12 section.

Phase 13 (Modding & Data Extensibility): Introduced descriptor pack loading & hot reload infrastructure focusing on biome descriptors. Added APIs in `world_gen.h` for pack meta, load (atomic swap), validate, summary, clear, migration registration, and CLI validation. Implemented in `world_gen_modding.c` with: pack.meta schema_version parsing, platform-specific directory scan for `*.biome.cfg`, safe file I/O (fopen_s on Windows), validation of loaded biome registry, migration callback registry scaffolding, and lazy initialization guard. Created unit test `test_worldgen_phase13_modding` covering valid pack load (schema_version=1), invalid pack rejection (missing pack.meta), hot reload with additional biome file, summary string content, and pack clearing. Roadmap Phase 13 entries marked Done (structures/resources integration & multi-step migrations deferred to future extension). CMake updated to compile new source.
