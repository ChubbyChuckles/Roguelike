feat(equipment phase11.1-11.4): analytics snapshot, histograms, MAD outlier detection
feat(equipment phase11.3): set & unique usage tracking

Completed Phase 11.3 analytics enhancement:
 - Added usage tracking accumulators for set ids and unique base item occurrences.
 - APIs: rogue_equipment_usage_record, rogue_equipment_usage_export_json producing compact JSON counts.
 - Updated test_equipment_phase11_analytics to exercise usage export path.
 - Roadmap: 11.3 moved from Partial to Done; README Phase 11 section updated to document new APIs.


Implemented Phase 11 analytics foundations:
 - JSON snapshot export (rogue_equipment_stats_export_json) for key aggregated stats.
 - Per rarity/slot DPS & EHP histograms with export (rogue_equipment_histograms_export_json) and recording API.
 - Median/MAD based DPS outlier detector (rogue_equipment_dps_outlier_flag) with rolling sample buffer.
 - Unit test test_equipment_phase11_analytics validates snapshot content, histogram population, and outlier flag after artificial spike.
 - Roadmap updated: 11.1, 11.2, 11.4 Done; 11.3 Partial (set/unique usage pending content tags); 11.7 test coverage basic Done.
 - README updated with Phase 11 section.

feat(equipment phase10.5 optional): crafting success chance scaling with skill

Added optional Phase 10.5 crafting success system:
 - New APIs: rogue_craft_set_skill / rogue_craft_get_skill manage crafting skill metric.
 - Success formula: 35% + skill*4 - rarity*5 - difficulty*3 (clamped 5..95) implemented with deterministic RNG path via rogue_craft_success_attempt.
 - Integrated upgrade gating: rogue_craft_attempt_upgrade wraps success check then applies upgrade stone on success.
 - Unit test test_equipment_phase10_crafting_success validates increased success distribution at higher skill and upgrade attempt eventual success.
 - Roadmap updated (10.5 Done) and README section added documenting formula & APIs.
