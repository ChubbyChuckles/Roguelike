feat(equipment phase10.5 optional): crafting success chance scaling with skill

Added optional Phase 10.5 crafting success system:
 - New APIs: rogue_craft_set_skill / rogue_craft_get_skill manage crafting skill metric.
 - Success formula: 35% + skill*4 - rarity*5 - difficulty*3 (clamped 5..95) implemented with deterministic RNG path via rogue_craft_success_attempt.
 - Integrated upgrade gating: rogue_craft_attempt_upgrade wraps success check then applies upgrade stone on success.
 - Unit test test_equipment_phase10_crafting_success validates increased success distribution at higher skill and upgrade attempt eventual success.
 - Roadmap updated (10.5 Done) and README section added documenting formula & APIs.
