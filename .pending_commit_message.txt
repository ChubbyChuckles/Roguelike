Inventory System Phase 3.3-3.5: Implemented auto-tag rule engine (rarity/category predicates) with deterministic application on first pickup, added accent color support (first matching rule precedence), persisted rules via new save component id=11 (inv_tag_rules), integrated rule application hook into pickup registration, added unit test `test_inventory_phase3_rules` (rule persistence & basic application), updated roadmap (3.3-3.5 Done, 3.6 partial), expanded README inventory section, and wired build (CMake) + save manager registrations.
Inventory System Phase 3.6: Completed enforcement & determinism tests. Added salvage/drop lock check into `inventory_ui` (returns early if locked/favorite). Added `test_inventory_phase3_lock_rule_enforce` verifying locked/favorite prevent salvage & drop (-3 code) and that rule order yields both tags with first color precedence. Roadmap updated (3.6 Done).
Inventory System Phase 4.1-4.3,4.2,4.7 (partial): Implemented query expression parser (AND/OR, predicates over rarity/qty/tag/equip_slot/affix_weight/quality/durability_pct/category), trigram-based fuzzy text search with lazy index + rebuild API, initial composite sort (single key: rarity, qty, name, category with optional descending), and unit test `test_inventory_phase4_query_sort` covering qty predicate, sort correctness, and fuzzy search invocation. Integrated new sources (`inventory_query.c/.h`) into build, updated roadmap marking 4.2 Done and 4.1/4.3/4.7 Partial, and expanded README with Phase 4 progress. Future work: multi-key stable chain, saved searches & quick action bar, incremental mutation re-index hooks, query result caching with LRU, fuzz & perf tests.
Inventory System Phase 4.3,4.4,4.7 (second wave partial): Extended composite sorting to multi-key chain (reverse application qsort) with descending markers, implemented saved searches registry (up to 16) with persistence via new save component id=12 (registered in save manager), added tests `test_inventory_phase4_saved_searches` and persistence round-trip `test_inventory_phase4_saved_searches_persist`, and added mutation hook API for future incremental fuzzy index updates. Updated roadmap (4.3 refined Partial, 4.4 Partial with persistence Done aspect, 4.5 hook noted, 4.7 expanded tests), updated README Phase 4 paragraph. Pending: UI quick action integration, stable secondary ordering guarantee, result cache & LRU (4.6), parser fuzz + leak/perf harness, and wiring mutation hook into item affix/quality/durability change paths.
