CI: enforce SDL=ON on Windows, run -j12; add docs build & HTML artifact upload

- CI (Windows): Flip ROGUE_ENABLE_SDL to ON, use --parallel 12 for build and ctest -j12.
- Add separate 'docs' job: install doxygen+graphviz, configure (SDL ON), build docs target, upload build/docs/html as artifact.
- Roadmap: mark CI docs integration as Partial; note new CI behavior under Recent Updates.
 - README: mention CI HTML docs artifact name (`docs-html`) and where to download it in Actions.
