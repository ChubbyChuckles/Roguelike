feat(skills): minimal EffectSpec system (Phase 1.2 partial) + skill linkage

Implements a foundational EffectSpec registry (module `effect_spec.c/h`) with first STAT_BUFF kind.
Extends `RogueSkillDef` with `effect_spec_id` and auto-applies linked effect on successful activation.
Adds new buff type `ROGUE_BUFF_STAT_STRENGTH`.
Unit test `test_effectspec_basic` registers a strength buff spec, links to a skill, activates, and asserts correct buff magnitude.
Roadmap updated (1.2 -> Partial) and README highlights updated.

Retains previously added AP economy (1.5 partial). Next steps: AP soft throttle, DOT/HOT effect kinds, stacking rules, snapshot vs dynamic scaling flags, effect persistence & HUD indicators.
