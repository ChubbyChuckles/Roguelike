UI: Implement Phase 4.4 Inventory Context Menu

Details:
- Extended `RogueUIInputState` with secondary mouse button fields (mouse2_pressed/released).
- Added context menu state to `RogueUIContext` (active flag, slot, selection index).
- Added new UI events: CONTEXT_OPEN, CONTEXT_SELECT, CONTEXT_CANCEL (enum values 6-8).
- Integrated context menu handling into `rogue_ui_inventory_grid`: right-click opens, arrow keys navigate, Activate selects, outside left-click cancels.
- Simple rendered menu panel with highlighted selection and items: Equip / Salvage / Compare / Cancel.
- New unit test `test_ui_phase4_context_menu` validating open, keyboard navigation (down/down), selection (Compare index=2), and cancel path via outside click.
- Roadmap updated (Phase 4.4 marked Done) and README updated with context menu description.

Follow-ups: integrate actions with real inventory/equipment systems, add controller radial variant (Phase 4.10), and hook rarity color theming per option.
