Dialogue System Phase 5: Localization Foundation
- Integrated dialogue system into runtime frame loop (update + render) with global UI context hook.
Dialogue System Phase 6: Typewriter & Skip Behavior
- Added global enable API `rogue_dialogue_typewriter_enable` controlling reveal speed (chars/ms).
- Render truncates text to revealed substring; advance during partial reveal completes line instead of moving forward (returns 2).
- Second advance proceeds to next line; test `test_dialogue_phase6_typewriter` validates two-step skip.
- Roadmap updated marking Phase 6 Done; README matrix advanced to Phase 6; commit message appended.
- Added localization registry (locale,key -> value) with upsert + active locale switching.
- Script authoring: lines beginning with [key] store key + inline fallback (allocated as key\0fallback).
- During rendering/log/current_text: lookup active locale value, fallback to inline fallback if missing.
- Token expansion applies after localization substitution.
- Added reset clearing registry + default locale 'en'.
- Unit test test_dialogue_phase5_localization covers registration, locale switch mid-script, restart under new locale.
- Roadmap & README updated (Phase 5 marked Done; feature matrix updated).
