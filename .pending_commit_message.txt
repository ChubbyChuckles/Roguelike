feat(items/loot phase16): personal loot mode & ownership scaffolding

Add multiplayer/personal loot initial slice:
- owner_player_id field on item instances + assignment API
- shared vs personal loot mode enum + setter/getter
- pickup gating honoring ownership in personal mode
- basic trade request transferring ownership (validation stub)
- placeholder need/greed roll API
- unit test test_loot_phase16_personal_mode validating shared vs personal pickup and trade flow
- roadmap updated (16.1/16.2 Done, 16.3/16.4 Partial)
- README highlights updated with Phase 16 summary

Future: full need/greed aggregation, anti-dup safeguards, robust trade validation & network authority integration.
