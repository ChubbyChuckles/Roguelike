Equipment Phase 16.1: External Item Definition JSON Tooling
- Added JSON import/export for equipment (item) base definitions: new APIs `rogue_item_defs_load_from_json` and `rogue_item_defs_export_json` alongside existing CSV loader.
- Parser: minimal hand-rolled forward-only scanner (whitespace skip, string & int number parsing) populating full `RogueItemDef` including implicit stats, set_id, socket_min/max with validation/clamps.
- Exporter: deterministic field ordering per object enabling clean diffs for editor pipelines; writes compact array form.
- Fast lookup integration: hash index rebuilt post JSON load; test exercises `rogue_item_def_index_fast` on loaded ids.
- Unit test `test_equipment_phase16_itemdefs_json` performs roundtrip: writes temp JSON (2 records), loads, asserts count & fast index presence, exports to buffer, checks for id tokens and representative numeric fields (level_req=5, base_armor=5), ensuring schema coverage.
- Roadmap updated marking 16.1 Done; README augmented with concise feature summary.
