UI Phase 4.5: Inline stat delta preview implemented

Summary:
- Added stat delta preview panel to `rogue_ui_inventory_grid` (simple damage proxy via item_id heuristic) with colored delta (green/red/gray).
- Introduced new events ROGUE_UI_EVENT_STAT_PREVIEW_SHOW / _HIDE and context state `stat_preview_slot`.
- Extended event enum and initialized state in UI context init.
- Added unit test `test_ui_phase4_stat_preview` covering show on hover, update between slots, and hide on exit.
- Updated roadmap marking 4.5 Done and README UI section with feature description.

Notes / Future:
- Placeholder comparison logic (uses item id modulus) to be replaced with real equipment stat diff (weapon damage, armor, affixes) in later phases.
- Will expand to multi-line aggregated stat categories and rarity-influenced styling alongside Phase 4.6 completion.
