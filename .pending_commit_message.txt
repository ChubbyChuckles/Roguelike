feat(ui): complete Phase 2.8 directional navigation & add Phase 3 input scaffolding

Implemented advanced directional focus navigation selecting nearest neighbor with axis bias and linear wrap fallback; activation toggles buttons/toggles via generic activation key. Added Phase 3 groundwork fields/APIs: modal index, controller state, clipboard & IME stubs, key repeat config storage, chord shortcut registration, input replay buffer APIs. Updated roadmap (2.8 Done; 3.1â€“3.6 Partial), README UI section, and added unit test adjustments; all Phase 2 tests pass.

feat(ui): implement Phase 3.3 clipboard+IME stubs, 3.5 chord shortcuts, 3.6 input replay, paste & replay tests

Added clipboard paste into text inputs, IME stub APIs, chord registration & two-key detection with timeout (Phase 3.5), input replay record/playback injection (Phase 3.6) and new unit test `test_ui_phase3_input_features` verifying paste, chord command execution, and replay character entry. Roadmap updated marking 3.3, 3.5, 3.6 Done; README augmented with Phase 3 progress. Phase 2 regression tests remain green.
