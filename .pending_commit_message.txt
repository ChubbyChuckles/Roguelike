Added rollback manager foundation: configurable ring buffer, capture, step_back, purge, dump, snapshot restore hook.
Extended rollback manager (Phase 5.4 progress): added delta vs full checkpoint storage, multi-system capture API, partial multi-system rollback, stats struct scaffolding, participant→system mapping stub, and expanded unit tests (multi-version rewind, partial rollback scenarios). Roadmap updated (5.4.1, 5.4.3, 5.4.6, 5.4.7 marked Done; others Partial).
Rollback manager enhancements: auto rollback API for participant (5.4.2 Done), validation hash check increments (5.4.4 Done), impact stats (systems_rewound/bytes_rewound). Roadmap & README updated; remaining: detailed per-op impact reporting + integration call site in tx abort.
Rollback event log & impact analysis (5.4.5 Done): added fixed ring of RogueRollbackEvent records (system, from_version, to_version, bytes, delta flag, auto flag), retrieval API, auto rollback test (`test_rollback_events`). README & roadmap updated; remaining minor: invoke auto rollback automatically within transaction abort helper.
State validation subsystem (Phase 5.5 complete): added state_validation_manager (per-system validators+repairs, cross rules, scheduling (interval/trigger/immediate), incremental hash skip, severity levels, event log, stats, dump). Added unit test `test_state_validation_manager`. Roadmap 5.5.1–5.5.7 marked Done; README updated.
Deadlock detection & prevention (Phase 5.6 complete): added deadlock_manager (resource dependency graph, DFS cycle detection, victim selection heuristic, abort callback hook, resource preemption & FIFO waiter promotion, stats & cycle log, dump API) with unit test `test_deadlock_manager`. Roadmap 5.6.1–5.6.7 marked Done; README updated.
Concurrency control & thread safety (Phase 5.7 foundation): added SDL-based threading primitives (`threading.c/.h`: semaphores, condvars, reusable barrier) and a lightweight thread pool (`thread_pool.c/.h`) built on an SDL-atomics SPSC ring with worker threads and semaphore signaling. Implemented thread priority control, debug yield knob, and stats snapshot (pending/peak_queue/worker_wakeups/submitted/executed). Added unit tests `test_thread_barrier` and `test_thread_pool` (both pass). Roadmap updated (5.7.1, 5.7.3, 5.7.4, 5.7.5, 5.7.7 Done; 5.7.2 & 5.7.6 Partial). README updated with Phase 5.7 summary.
