Phase 15 (Integrity & Anti-Cheat Foundations) – GUIDs + Equip Hash Chain

Implemented initial multiplayer integrity scaffolding:
 - 15.3 GUIDs: Added 64-bit per-item GUID field (spawn-time deterministic mix of instance index, def id, quantity). Accessible via API. Uniqueness test over multiple spawns passes (no collisions in pool).
 - 15.2 Equip Hash Chain: Rolling 64-bit hash updated on every equip and unequip (slot id + GUID + action salt mixed). Provides tamper-evident sequence for future server reconciliation / replay audit.
 - 15.1 Validation Scaffolding: Equip path already enforces slot legality & two-hand constraints; with GUID & chain present, server validator (future) can recompute and compare chain state, detect duplicated GUID reuse, or illegal transitions.
 - Data Model: Extended RogueItemInstance with guid + equip_hash_chain fields; initialization added to spawn logic.
 - Equip Logic: `rogue_equip_try` and `rogue_equip_unequip` now update hash chain post legality checks.
 - Tests: New `test_equipment_phase15_integrity` validates GUID uniqueness and hash chain progression (0 -> non-zero on equip, changed on unequip).
 - Roadmap: Phase 15 items 15.1–15.3 marked Done (scaffolding for 15.1) with notes; remaining 15.4–15.6 pending.
 - README: Added Phase 15 section documenting GUIDs, hash chain, test coverage, and remaining work.

Follow-ups (deferred): replay auditor (proc rate anomaly detection), banned affix blacklist ingestion, server-side authoritative validation harness, negative tests for chain tampering and duplicate GUID injection.
