feat(hit-system): complete Phase 4 feedback (particles, refined knockback, SFX stub, overkill explosion flag)

Implements full Phase 4 of hit system roadmap:
 - Added hit_feedback module (particles, knockback magnitude, SFX stub, explosion tracking)
 - Refined knockback scaling: level + strength differential with clamp (0.18 -> 0.55)
 - Particle bursts (normal 10-14 rand, overkill 24, capped) with directional spread off impact normal
 - Overkill/execution triggers larger burst & explosion frame flag
 - Integrated feedback into combat_strike (first-hit SFX stub, per-enemy flash, knockback apply)
 - Added enemy level field for future balancing (currently default 0 if not set)
 - Added tests: test_hit_phase4_feedback (magnitude growth & cap, particle count ranges) + existing knockback_basic retained
 - Roadmap updated: Phases 1-4 marked Done, status summary advanced
 - Build system: added hit_feedback.c

Future work: Phase 5 slash VFX overlay, Phase 6 debug textual overlay & explosion visualization, performance profiling & tuning.
