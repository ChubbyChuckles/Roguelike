Equipment System Phase 1 - Slot Expansion (Initial)
 - Added expanded equipment slot enum: weapon, offhand, full armor set (head/chest/legs/hands/feet), jewelry (ring1/ring2/amulet), utility (belt/cloak), charms (charm1/charm2).
 - Implemented offhand slot and two-handed occupancy plumbing (detection stub currently always false; future weapon flag to drive logic).
 - Updated stat cache armor aggregation to ignore jewelry/charms & include new armor slots.
 - Added placeholder category mapping (offhand/jewelry temporarily treated as armor category until distinct categories introduced).
 - Added basic unit test `test_equipment_phase1_slots` ensuring new headers compile & slot API callable.
 - Updated roadmap (implementation_equipment_system.txt) marking Phase 1.1/1.3 Done, 1.2/1.4/1.7 Partial.
Next: persist new slots (save/load migration), implement true two-hand weapon flag in weapon defs, robust equip/unequip transactional tests, dedicated categories for shields/foci & jewelry stat contributions.
