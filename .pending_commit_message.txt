UI Phase 4.8: Vendor transaction confirmation modal & insufficient funds UX

Summary:
- Added vendor confirmation modal (ENTER opens/accepts, ESC cancels) displaying item name & price with affordability tint.
- Insufficient funds attempt triggers ~0.5s red flash overlay (timer decremented per frame).
- Added app state fields: vendor_confirm_active/def_index/price & vendor_insufficient_flash_ms.
- Input handling refactored: RETURN now opens modal first, second RETURN inside modal performs purchase if affordable.
- Warning-safe alpha calculation (casts/clamps) for flash overlay.
- Extended UI event enum with placeholders for future vendor events (confirm open/accept/cancel/insufficient) to support later event-driven tests (currently modal logic test is headless procedural; events can be wired subsequently).
- Added unit test `test_ui_phase4_vendor_transaction` (fabricated vendor item) verifying modal activation, insufficient funds flash, gold top-up, and purchase increment.
- Roadmap marked Phase 4.8 Done; README updated with new feature description.

Notes / Follow-ups:
- Future: integrate real item definition lookup in confirmation test once item defs are exposed without heavy asset IO.
- Vendor event emissions (ROGUE_UI_EVENT_VENDOR_*) can be hooked into input path for richer telemetry if/when UI context is integrated with vendor panel interactions.
