Persistence: Phase 2 migration runner + metrics, ordering & metrics tests

- Implemented incremental migration runner with rollback safety and metrics (steps, ms, failure flag) in `save_manager.c`.
- Added public accessors: `rogue_save_last_migration_steps/failed/ms`.
- Added migration metrics & chain tests: `test_save_migration_chain`, `test_save_migration_metrics`.
- Added ordering determinism test `test_save_ordering_determinism` (verifies checksum stability across registration order).
- Enhanced roadmap: marked 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 Done; expanded 10.1 test coverage status.
- Updated README persistence section with migration runner, metrics, and new tests.
- Refactored test harness now validates v1->v2 header downgrade upgrade path.
- No data-transform migrations yet (v1->v2 remains no-op) but infrastructure supports future schema evolution.
