UI Phase 6.2: Layered HUD Bars & AP Integration
- Added hud_bars.c/h implementing layered (primary + trailing secondary) smoothing model for Health, Mana, and new Action Point (AP) bars (fraction-per-second catchup; instant snap on heals).
- Integrated into hud.c rendering: secondary darker lag fill behind brighter primary; added AP bar below XP with consistent frame.
- New unit test test_ui_phase6_bars_ap exercises: full initialization, damage-induced lag (secondary > primary immediately after drop), convergence over simulated time, and instant snap on heal.
- Roadmap updated Phase 6.2 -> Done with test reference; README UI section notes new API & behavior.
