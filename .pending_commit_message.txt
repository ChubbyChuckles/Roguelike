docs(ci): build Doxygen with SDL=ON and -j12, upload Pages + docs-html artifacts, auto-deploy to GitHub Pages; update roadmap status and README docs section

tests: fix parallel flake in cfg migration simplified by isolating temp dirs; full suite green (561/561)

- Simplified migration unit now uses unique TEST_SOURCE_DIR/TEST_TARGET_DIR to avoid clashes with the full migration tests when running in parallel (-j12).
- Re-ran full Debug suite with SDL2: 561/561 passing.
- Roadmap checkpoint updated with flake note; added docs/DOXYGEN_GUIDE.md and linked it from README.
