Phase 14 (Perf & Memory) – Initial Slice

Implemented performance foundation for equipment aggregation:
 - Added equipment_perf.c/h with SoA per-slot stat arrays and total accumulators (14.1 Done).
 - Added linear frame arena allocator (alloc/reset/high-water) (14.2 Partial – not yet widely adopted outside perf test).
 - Added pseudo-SIMD 4-slot batch aggregation path alongside scalar path; results parity validated (14.3 Done conceptually; real intrinsics deferred for portability).
 - Added lightweight micro-profiler (zone begin/end, stats dump) and instrumented aggregation variants (14.5 Done).
 - New test test_equipment_phase14_perf: spawns items, runs scalar then simd aggregation, asserts identical totals, profiler zone capture, arena bounds, and prints metrics (14.6 Done).
 - Roadmap updated (14.1, 14.3, 14.5, 14.6 Done; 14.2 Partial; 14.4 still X).

Phase 14 (Performance & Memory) Expansion: Complete Arena Integration + Parallel Loadout Optimization

Equipment System Phase 14 updates:
- 14.2 (Arena) Completed: Frame arena now actively used by loadout optimizer for candidate buffers; high-water tracking validated; prevents transient heap pressure.
- 14.4 (Parallel Affinity) Implemented: Added async optimizer API (launch/join/running). Win32 worker thread executes deterministic hill-climb search; portable fallback runs synchronously when threading unsupported.
- Optimizer Enhancements: Integrated profiler zone ("optimize") plus async launch zone; candidate enumeration allocates via arena; no heap allocations required on steady state.
- Profiler Coverage: Aggregation (scalar/simd), synchronous optimize, async launch. JSON dump API unchanged.
- Tests: Added test_equipment_phase14_parallel covering async improvement, join semantics, and arena reuse (capacity not exceeded). Updated CMake to register new test. Arena reuse test ensures high-water does not exceed capacity across sequential optimizations.
- README: Phase 14 section revised to reflect completed 14.2 & 14.4 and expanded test coverage.
- Roadmap: Updated statuses (14.2 Done, 14.4 Done) with implementation notes.

Determinism & Safety: Search ordering unchanged (slot then instance index), ensuring reproducible results regardless of async execution timing. Fallback path maintains API contract cross-platform.

Next Targets: Potential true SIMD intrinsics (feature-gated), profiler diff tooling, and future Phase 15 multiplayer integrity hooks.
