feat(skills): cast weaving (1A.2 partial) + early cancel scaling (1A.4 partial) + adaptive haste & buffering groundwork

Adds min_weave_ms to `RogueSkillDef` enforcing minimum separation between successive casts of the same skill (Phase 1A.2 partial). Currently no haste override; future enhancement will relax gate under sufficient haste.

Implements early cancel API `rogue_skill_try_cancel` enabling partial cast completion after reaching `early_cancel_min_pct`. Effect callback receives `partial_scalar` (linear progress fraction) via extended `RogueSkillCtx` (Phase 1A.4 partial). Cancelling applies skill effect & EffectSpec proportionally (future: non-linear scaling curves, resource refund tiers).

Extends tests:
 - `test_cast_weave_and_cancel` validates early cancel scalar (~0.4), weaving lockout (<min_weave_ms fails, after passes).
 - Existing buffering (`test_input_buffer_cast`), haste (`test_haste_cast_speed`), channel ticks (`test_channel_ticks_and_buffer`) remain green.

Roadmap updates: 1A.2, 1A.4 marked Partial; 1A.6 expanded to include weave/cancel scalar test coverage.

Next steps: haste-aware weave bypass, drift-corrected channel scheduling, non-linear early cancel scaling curve, DOT/HOT EffectSpec kinds, combo builder/spender implementation.
