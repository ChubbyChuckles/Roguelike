Equipment Phase 16.4: Runeword Recipe Validator

Summary:
- Implemented runeword pattern validation API `rogue_runeword_validate_pattern` (lowercase alphanumeric + single underscores, max 5 segments, length <=11, rejects empty / double underscore / invalid chars).
- Integrated validator into `rogue_runeword_register` (returns -3 when invalid) to prevent impossible or malformed patterns entering registry.
- Added comprehensive unit test `test_equipment_phase16_runeword_validator` covering failure cases (null, empty, uppercase, invalid symbol, segment overflow, double underscore) and success cases including max segment pattern; verifies registration rejection on invalid pattern.
- Updated roadmap marking Phase 16.4 Done with description.
- Minor: Added public prototype to `equipment_content.h`.

Rationale:
Prevents silent acceptance of malformed runeword recipes which would undermine deterministic matching & future crafting UI. Guarding early simplifies content tooling and future hotâ€‘reload diffing.

Testing:
New test passes (Release build) alongside existing Phase 16.x tests. No warnings introduced.

Equipment Phase 16.5: Budget Analyzer Report Generator

Summary:
- Added `equipment_budget_analyzer.{h,c}` implementing aggregate affix budget utilization scan across active item instances.
- Report fields: item_count, over_budget_count, avg_utilization, max_utilization + index, histogram buckets (<25,<50,<75,<90,<=100,>100).
- Deterministic JSON export API `rogue_budget_analyzer_export_json` for CI / telemetry ingestion.
- Unit test `test_equipment_phase16_budget_analyzer` spawns synthetic items to exercise each utilization bucket plus an intentional over-budget case; asserts bucket population, over_budget_count >=1, and JSON field presence.

Rationale:
Provides immediate visibility into affix budget distribution enabling early detection of systemic power creep or overly generous roll patterns before broader content expansion. Histogram design matches existing analytics style (Phase 11) for consistency.

Testing:
New test passes locally with existing Phase 16 suite. JSON output manually inspected for deterministic key ordering.
