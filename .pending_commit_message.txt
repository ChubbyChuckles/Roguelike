feat(equipment phase10.1-10.3): crafting & upgrade pipelines (upgrade stones, affix transfer orbs, fusion)

Implemented Phase 10.1–10.3 equipment crafting features:
 - Upgrade Stones: API rogue_item_instance_apply_upgrade_stone tiers item_level and leverages existing upgrade logic for budget-respecting affix elevation.
 - Affix Transfer: Added per-instance orb storage fields (stored_affix_index/value/used) with extraction (rogue_item_instance_affix_extract) and application (rogue_item_instance_affix_orb_apply) enforcing slot vacancy, one-time consumption, and budget cap.
 - Fusion: rogue_item_instance_fusion transfers highest-value affix from sacrificed donor to target if slot free and within remaining budget, deactivating donor atomically.
 - Added comprehensive unit test test_equipment_phase10_crafting validating upgrade progression, extraction->apply path, one-time orb use, fusion increases total affix weight, donor deactivation, and budget adherence. Roadmap updated (10.1–10.3 Done; 10.6 tests Done).
 - README updated with new Phase 10.1–10.3 section.
