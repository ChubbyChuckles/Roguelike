Skills Phase 7.6 + Phase 8.1–8.4: central coefficients module, soft-cap clamp, and full proc tests

- Add centralized skill coefficients registry (src/core/skills/skills_coeffs.{h,c}) with base + per-rank scalar and STR/DEX/INT contributions (percent per 10).
- Integrate into runtime via skill_get_effective_coefficient; include in build.
- Enforce soft-cap using rogue_soft_cap_apply plus hard clamp to cap per stat to satisfy expected bounds under extreme stats.
- Unit tests: add/green test_skills_phase8_coeffs; ensure Phase 7 proc suite fully green (ICD, probability smoothing, loop guard, dynamic scaling, regression).
- Roadmap: mark Phase 7.6 and Phase 8.1–8.4 as Done.

Skillsystem Phase 7.4–7.5: Anti-proc loop guard + dynamic scaling; tests and docs

- Implement loop guard in skills procs: depth cap (8) and cycle signature hash to prevent cyclic proc storms; deterministic suppression with single warn-once overflow.
- Add dynamic proc scaling: per-proc recent-window chance reduction (~12% per extra recent trigger, capped at ~60%), integrated with existing deterministic RNG + optional smoothing.
- Unit test `tests/unit/test_skills_phase7_4_5_loop_and_scaling.c`: validates loop protection and scaling under bursty triggers; disables buff dampening for rapid stacking; assertions use `rogue_buffs_get_total`.
- Roadmap updated: mark 7.4/7.5 Done with details; README gains a subsection documenting safety and scaling behavior.
- All Phase 7 tests (7.1–7.5) pass locally in Debug with SDL2 and parallel runs (-j16).

Skills Phase 9.1–9.4: Persistence for extended skill state and active buffs; versioning, varints, replay hash, and signature tests

- Save manager writes/reads extended skills (rank, cooldown_end_ms, cast_progress_ms, channel_end_ms, next_charge_ready_ms, charges_cur, casting_active, channel_active) with legacy detection by payload size.
- Buffs persist as (type, magnitude, remaining_ms relative to now); legacy absolute end-time layout auto-detected and converted.
- Versioned TLV sections with varint counts (v4+); includes replay hash and a signature stub for tamper detection.
- Tests green in Debug SDL2: `test_save_phase7_skill_buff_roundtrip`, `test_save_phase7_skill_buff_extensions`, `test_persistence_versions`, `test_save_v4_varint_counts`, `test_save_v8_replay_hash`, `test_save_v9_signature`.
- Roadmap updated: mark Phase 9.1–9.4 Done; README gains “Skills Persistence (Phase 9)”.
