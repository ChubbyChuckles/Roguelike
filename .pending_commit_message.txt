Dialogue System Phase 5: Localization Foundation
- Added localization registry (locale,key -> value) with upsert + active locale switching.
- Script authoring: lines beginning with [key] store key + inline fallback (allocated as key\0fallback).
- During rendering/log/current_text: lookup active locale value, fallback to inline fallback if missing.
- Token expansion applies after localization substitution.
- Added reset clearing registry + default locale 'en'.
- Unit test test_dialogue_phase5_localization covers registration, locale switch mid-script, restart under new locale.
- Roadmap & README updated (Phase 5 marked Done; feature matrix updated).
