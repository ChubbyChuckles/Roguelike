Dialogue: Fix character rendering (lowercase mapping + robust wrapping) and add avatar support (speaker@image syntax + registry + runtime panel display).
Dialogue: Add style/theming system (gradient, shadow, blinking prompt, caret) and avatar config file loader + external mapping API.
Dialogue System Phase 7: Analytics & Runtime UI Fixes

Summary:
- Fixed dialogue runtime panel truncation (proper wrapping & reveal substring logic) ensuring full text renders during typewriter.
- Added runtime SDL renderer helper (previous commit) now validated for full character output.
- Implemented Phase 7 analytics: per-script line view counter, last view timestamp, and cumulative FNV1a digest across viewed lines.
- Added public API rogue_dialogue_analytics_get(script_id,&lines,&last_ms,&digest).
- Updated logging path to trigger analytics updates exactly once per first display of each line.
- Added unit test test_dialogue_phase7_analytics validating counter increment & digest mutation.
- Roadmap updated marking Phase 7 Done; README matrix advanced (next: Performance & Memory phase).
- Appended commit message and kept SDL2 compile guard intact; all dialogue tests (0–7) pass.

Testing:
- Built Release with SDL2; ran dialogue suite (phases 0–7) – all Passed.
- Verified analytics digest changes after additional line.
