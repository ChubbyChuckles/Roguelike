feat(loot-gen): implement affix gating, quality scalar & duplicate avoidance (8.2,8.4,8.6,8.7)

Adds:
- Affix gating by item category: damage affixes restricted to weapons; agility to weapons/armor/gems.
- Quality scalar system with global min/max and player luck driven interpolation.
- Scaled affix value roll function (biased upward for higher quality) with deterministic RNG.
- Duplicate affix avoidance when selecting prefix/suffix in generation pipeline.
- Integrated gating/quality into generation path replacing legacy direct affix selection.

Tests:
- New unit test `test_loot_phase8_generation_quality` validating gating, quality bias, duplicate avoidance.
- Updated implementation plan marking 8.2,8.4,8.6,8.7 Done.

Internal:
- Added `rogue_affix_roll_value_scaled` utility.
- Extended generation module with gated roll helper and luck->quality mapping.

Next: proceed to 9.x dynamic drop balancing layer.feat(loot): implement advanced generation API (8.1, 8.3, 8.5) and tests

Adds new module loot_generation (context-driven item creation) including:
- Generation context struct (enemy level, biome, archetype, player luck)
- Seed mixing helper (8.5) for deterministic yet varied outputs
- Multi-pass rarity->item->affix flow (8.3) via existing roll_ex path
- Rarity floor influence from enemy level + global floor integration
- Hooks affix rolling into spawned instance

Introduces quality scalar config stub (future 8.4 work) and placeholder affix gating hook (8.2).

Adds unit test test_loot_phase8_generation_basic covering:
- Context-driven rarity floor
- Deterministic reproduction with same seed/context

Marks roadmap items 8.1, 8.3, 8.5 as Done in implementation_plan.txt.

Also integrates module into build system.
