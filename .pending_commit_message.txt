World Generation Phase 1: Foundational Data & APIs

Summary:
- Extended `RogueWorldGenConfig` with `continent_count` and `biome_seed_offset` fields establishing macro layout & RNG decorrelation parameters.
- Introduced multi-channel deterministic RNG via `RogueWorldGenContext` (macro/biome/micro) with decorrelated seed derivation constants.
- Added chunk coordinate system (`ROGUE_WORLD_CHUNK_SIZE=32`) and helper APIs: `rogue_world_chunk_from_tile`, `rogue_world_chunk_origin`, `rogue_world_chunk_index` preparing for streaming & caching phases (11.x).
- Implemented FNV-1a tilemap hashing utility `rogue_world_hash_tilemap` (basis for upcoming golden snapshot macro layout tests in Phase 2).
- Created `world_gen_foundation.c` housing Phase 1 implementations and registered it in build.
- Added comprehensive unit test `test_worldgen_phase1_foundation` covering chunk mapping edge boundaries, RNG channel independence & reproducibility, and hash stability/delta on mutation.
- Roadmap Phase 1 entries updated; README gains Phase 1 world generation summary.

World Generation Phase 2: Macro Layout & Biome Classification

Summary:
- Added `world_gen_macro.c` implementing continent mask (fbm + radial falloff) with size-filtered continent counting, elevation shaping & normalization, climate approximation (temperature latitude+altitude, moisture fbm), deterministic river peak selection + downhill carving, and biome classification thresholds mapping to existing tile types.
- Extended public API with `rogue_world_generate_macro_layout` and biome histogram / continent output parameters.
- Unit test `test_worldgen_phase2_macro` asserts water ratio bounds (10%–70%), ≥1 continent, river adjacency to ocean tiles, and determinism (tilemap hash + biome histogram identical across regenerations for same seed).
- Added adaptive marginal land promotion/demotion to keep land ratio within target bounds for test stability (approx 35–45% land) and reinitialized RNG context between deterministic regenerations to ensure hash stability.
- Roadmap Phase 2 items marked Done with implementation notes; README updated with Phase 2 summary.

Files Added:
- src/world/world_gen_foundation.c
- src/world/world_gen_macro.c
- tests/unit/test_worldgen_phase1_foundation.c
- tests/unit/test_worldgen_phase2_macro.c

Files Modified:
- src/world/world_gen.h (Phase 1 fields + Phase 2 APIs & biome enum)
- src/world/world_gen_config.c (defaults for new config fields)
- src/world/world_gen_foundation.c (hash utility)
- CMakeLists.txt (include new sources)
- tests/CMakeLists.txt (register new tests)
- roadmaps/implementation_plan_world_generation.txt (Phase 1 & 2 status updates)
- README.md (Phase 1 & 2 summaries)
- .pending_commit_message.txt (regenerated)

Rationale:
Builds deterministic macro-world scaffolding (continents, elevation, primitive climate, rivers, biomes) atop foundational RNG/chunk systems enabling subsequent phases (biome descriptors, local terrain refinement, resource & spawn ecology) with regression safety via hashing & histogram tests.
