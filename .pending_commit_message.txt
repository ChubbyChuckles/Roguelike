CI: enforce SDL=ON on Windows, run -j12; add docs build & HTML artifact upload

- CI (Windows): Flip ROGUE_ENABLE_SDL to ON, use --parallel 12 for build and ctest -j12.
- Add separate 'docs' job: install doxygen+graphviz, configure (SDL ON), build docs target, upload build/docs/html as artifact.
- Roadmap: mark CI docs integration as Partial; note new CI behavior under Recent Updates.
 - README: mention CI HTML docs artifact name (`docs-html`) and where to download it in Actions.

Overlay: Skills Manager Panel + skill_debug APIs; all tests green (560/560)

- New panel: "Skills" lets you select a skill, edit timing (cooldown/cast/channel) and RogueSkillCoeffParams, and run a 2s simulate (single skill) with JSON output.
- New core APIs: src/core/skills/skill_debug.{h,c} provide list/get/set for coeffs & timing and a simulate wrapper (headless-safe; used by tests and overlay).
- Minor core addition: expose rogue_skill_coeff_get_params to fetch current coeff struct.
- Tests: added tests/unit/test_skill_debug_api.c (covers list/get/set + simulate); full Debug SDL2 suite now passes 560/560 in parallel (-j8).
- Roadmap: mark Phase 7.1 and 7.2 Done; 7.4/7.5 Partial.
