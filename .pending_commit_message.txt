UI Phase 5.4–5.7: Skill Graph Synergy Panel Plumbing, Tag Filtering, Build Export/Import, Undo Buffer

Details:
- Added tag bitmask to skill graph nodes + filter mask in context; quadtree emission skips non-matching when mask set.
- Export/import APIs (`rogue_ui_skillgraph_export` / `rogue_ui_skillgraph_import`) using compact text lines `icon:rank/max;tags` with manual parser (no sscanf dependency) and bounds checking for ranks.
- Allocation API (`rogue_ui_skillgraph_allocate`) increments rank (if below max) and records previous rank in undo stack (depth 64) while triggering pulse animation.
- Undo API (`rogue_ui_skillgraph_undo`) restores last allocation (LIFO) preserving other nodes untouched.
- Synergy panel enable flag + API (`rogue_ui_skillgraph_enable_synergy_panel`) introduced (placeholder – no visual aggregation yet) establishing integration point for future passive stat summary.
- Updated existing tests to new `rogue_ui_skillgraph_add` signature including tags parameter.
- New unit test `test_ui_phase5_skillgraph_advanced` validates: baseline emission, tag filter reducing emitted set, export non-empty, allocation + undo functioning, modified export import applying rank changes, final rebuild success.
- Replaced duplicate quadtree emission function with single filtered version; removed unsafe `sscanf` usage (manual parse) to avoid MSVC warnings.
- README and roadmap updated marking 5.4–5.7 Done with feature summaries.

Deferred:
- Actual rendering/content of synergy aggregate panel (currently plumbing only) will accumulate & display passive bonuses in later theming pass.
- Persistent storage of exported build outside transient buffer (to integrate with save system).
- Multi-step branching undo (beyond rank decrements) and redo stack.

Testing:
- `test_ui_phase5_skillgraph`, `test_ui_phase5_skillgraph_anim`, and new `test_ui_phase5_skillgraph_advanced` all pass locally (Release, SDL enabled).
