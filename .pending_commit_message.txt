AI Phase 9.4: Agent pooling & reinit

Added ai/core/ai_agent_pool.{c,h} implementing a slab-based reusable pool for EnemyAIBlackboard wrapper blocks (512Bâ†’2KB slab final) eliminating per-enable malloc/free churn. Integrated pool into rogue_enemy_ai_bt_enable/disable replacing calloc/free with acquire/release. Added diagnostic APIs (in_use, free, peak, slab_size) and unit test test_ai_phase9_agent_pool validating:
 - Peak allocation caps at first wave (16) and does not grow on subsequent reuse cycles
 - All blocks returned (in_use=0) after disable cycles; free list >= peak
 - Re-acquiring subset does not increase peak
Scheduler & LOD (9.2/9.3) unchanged; roadmap & README updated with Phase 9.4 status.
