Added rollback manager foundation: configurable ring buffer, capture, step_back, purge, dump, snapshot restore hook.
Extended rollback manager (Phase 5.4 progress): added delta vs full checkpoint storage, multi-system capture API, partial multi-system rollback, stats struct scaffolding, participantâ†’system mapping stub, and expanded unit tests (multi-version rewind, partial rollback scenarios). Roadmap updated (5.4.1, 5.4.3, 5.4.6, 5.4.7 marked Done; others Partial).
Rollback manager enhancements: auto rollback API for participant (5.4.2 Done), validation hash check increments (5.4.4 Done), impact stats (systems_rewound/bytes_rewound). Roadmap & README updated; remaining: detailed per-op impact reporting + integration call site in tx abort.
