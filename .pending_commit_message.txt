feat(metrics): implement session loot metrics (phase 9.5)

Add session metrics subsystem enhancements:
- Session counters in app state (drops, pickups, rarity breakdown)
- Metrics API: session elapsed, record_drop/pickup, rates(items/hour + rarity/hour)
- Integration points: enemy loot spawn, single-item generation path, pickup handling
- Unit test (test_loot_phase9_session_metrics) validating rate computation via simulated elapsed time
- README updated with phase 9.5 description
- Roadmap implementation_plan.txt marks 9.5 as Done

Also expose session metric functions in metrics.h for future tuning commands (9.6).
