Equipment System Phase 1 completion & Phase 2 initial layering

Phase 1 (recap):
- Added additional equip slots (ring1, ring2, amulet, belt, boots, cloak, charm_a/b, offhand)
- Two-handed weapon occupancy logic + atomic equip/unequip enforcement
- Cosmetic transmog layer per-slot with category validation APIs
- Persistence migration for new slots; save/load roundtrip test
- New test assets (test_equipment_items.cfg) and unit tests: test_equipment_phase1_slots, test_equipment_phase1_transmog, test_equipment_phase1_persistence (atomicity + save/load)

Phase 2 (Advanced Stat Aggregation) initial implementation:
- Implemented layered stat cache structure (base/implicit/affix/buff/total per primary attribute) (2.1 Done)
- Added derived metric scaffolding: dps_estimate, ehp_estimate, toughness_index, mobility_index, sustain_index placeholder (2.2 Partial)
- Introduced soft cap helper function rogue_soft_cap_apply (2.4 Partial)
- Added deterministic fingerprint hashing over layered + derived numeric fields (rogue_stat_cache_fingerprint) (2.5 Done)
- New unit test test_equipment_phase2_stat_cache validating:
	* Layer integrity (base vs total)
	* Fingerprint changes on stat mutation
	* Soft cap curve reduces over-cap values while preserving below-cap values (2.6 Partial)
- Updated equipment roadmap: mark 2.1 Done, 2.2/2.4/2.6 Partial, 2.5 Done
- Updated README changelog with Phase 1 completion and Phase 2 progress highlights

Next steps (not yet implemented):
- Populate implicit & affix layers from item defs and affix stats
- Apply soft caps to specific aggregated metrics (dexterity->attack speed, vitality->EHP) and add monotonic derivative tests
- Add ordering invariance test (equip sequence independence) and extended fingerprint determinism under multi-slot changes
