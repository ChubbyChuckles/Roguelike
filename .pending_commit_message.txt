Inventory System Phase 3.3-3.5: Implemented auto-tag rule engine (rarity/category predicates) with deterministic application on first pickup, added accent color support (first matching rule precedence), persisted rules via new save component id=11 (inv_tag_rules), integrated rule application hook into pickup registration, added unit test `test_inventory_phase3_rules` (rule persistence & basic application), updated roadmap (3.3-3.5 Done, 3.6 partial), expanded README inventory section, and wired build (CMake) + save manager registrations.
Inventory System Phase 3.6: Completed enforcement & determinism tests. Added salvage/drop lock check into `inventory_ui` (returns early if locked/favorite). Added `test_inventory_phase3_lock_rule_enforce` verifying locked/favorite prevent salvage & drop (-3 code) and that rule order yields both tags with first color precedence. Roadmap updated (3.6 Done).
