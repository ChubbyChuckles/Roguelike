combat: heavy_2 triple-window test + multi-hit robustness & combo scaling fix

Phase 1A incremental combat updates:
- Added `test_combat_heavy_multi_window` validating heavy_2 three sequential active windows (damage applied per window, duplicate prevention via processed_window_mask, BEGIN/END events = 6 total).
- Preserved const safety (removed prior experimental in-place caching); attack window structs keep sentinel start_frame/end_frame (-1) for future authoring tools.
- Retained `rogue_attack_window_frame_span` helper (pure, no mutation) for external frame mapping & validation.
- Fixed earlier combo scaling regression: reset `processed_window_mask` when `strike_time_ms` returns to 0 (isolated test harness strikes).

Docs & Plan:
- README updated (multi-hit details, heavy_2 triple-window mention, frame span helper).
- implementation_plan_combatsystem.txt updated under 1A.7 with heavy_2 test completion + notes on mask reset rationale.

Tests:
- New heavy multi-window test passes (expected dmg sequence & 6 events).
- All existing combat tests (multi-hit, events, combo scaling) remain green.

Follow-ups:
- Remaining Phase 1A coverage: boundary cancel edge tests (exact frame start/end, hit vs whiff thresholds) & overlapping window stacking scenario.
- Status buildup threshold/decay system (bleed/frost) integration (Phase 2/3).
- FX/SFX consumer layer for window events (Phase 1A.5 continuation).
