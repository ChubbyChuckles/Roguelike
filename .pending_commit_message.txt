Itemsystem Phase 18.3/18.4/18.5: Advanced loot analytics features
Itemsystem Phase 19.1: Per-rarity pickup sounds mapping
- Added rarity->pickup sound id storage (strings) with APIs rogue_rarity_set_pickup_sound / rogue_rarity_get_pickup_sound alongside existing spawn sound mapping.
- Integrated pickup sound lookup into loot pickup loop; logs chosen sound id (audio playback stub for now) preserving deterministic behavior.
- Added unit test test_loot_phase19_1_pickup_sounds verifying spawn, pickup deactivation, and absence of crash with configured pickup sounds.
- Updated roadmap (19.1 Done) and README with Phase 19.1 feature summary.
Itemsystem Phases 19.2–19.5: Loot visual polish (sparkle, beam, edge notifier, pulse)
- Introduced loot_vfx module (loot_vfx.c/h) maintaining per-instance visual state (sparkle timer, beam_active, pulse_active & alpha) plus edge notifier counting.
- Integrated spawn/despawn/update hooks in loot_instances.c (calls rogue_loot_vfx_on_spawn/on_despawn and rogue_loot_vfx_update).
- Implemented rarity>=3 beam pillar flag; sparkle timer cycles every 1.2s (placeholder for frame selection); pulse engages final 5s before despawn with normalized alpha ramp.
- Added query APIs rogue_loot_vfx_get and rogue_loot_vfx_edge_notifiers for UI consumption & testing.
- Added unit test test_loot_phase19_2_5_vfx validating spawn state, pulse activation, alpha monotonic increase, and cleanup after despawn.
- Roadmap entries 19.2–19.5 marked Done and README updated with feature summary.
