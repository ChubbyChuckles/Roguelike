feat(ui): complete Phase 3 input abstraction (routing, controller axes, key repeat, chords, replay)

Implements full Phase 3 UI Interaction model:
 - 3.1 Input routing & modal gating: modal index enforces focus, widgets early‑out when outside modal.
 - 3.2 Controller mapping: analog axis threshold -> directional intents + integrated with repeat timers.
 - 3.3 Clipboard/IME already present; paste functional in TextInput.
 - 3.4 Key repeat: per-key state (arrows, tab, activate, axes) with initial delay (400ms) + interval (65ms) generating synthetic move/activate pulses.
 - 3.5 Chord shortcuts: two-step Ctrl+<k1> then <k2> within timeout updates last command id.
 - 3.6 Input replay: record & playback now capture injected frames before navigation.

Additional details:
 - Added modal gating checks to Button/Toggle/Slider/TextInput.
 - Added axis intent & repeat reuse; helper repeat function consolidated.
 - Updated roadmap marking 3.1–3.6 Done; README UI section now reflects Phase 1–3 completion.
 - All Phase 2 & Phase 3 UI tests pass (no regressions).

No changes to public APIs beyond finalized Phase 3 fields; future Phase 4 (inventory UI) can build atop stable input layer.
