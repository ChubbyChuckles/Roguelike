feat(hit-system): complete Phase 4 feedback (particles, refined knockback, SFX stub, overkill explosion flag)

Implements full Phase 4 of hit system roadmap:
 - Added hit_feedback module (particles, knockback magnitude, SFX stub, explosion tracking)
 - Refined knockback scaling: level + strength differential with clamp (0.18 -> 0.55)
 - Particle bursts (normal 10-14 rand, overkill 24, capped) with directional spread off impact normal
 - Overkill/execution triggers larger burst & explosion frame flag
 - Integrated feedback into combat_strike (first-hit SFX stub, per-enemy flash, knockback apply)
 - Added enemy level field for future balancing (currently default 0 if not set)
 - Added tests: test_hit_phase4_feedback (magnitude growth & cap, particle count ranges) + existing knockback_basic retained
 - Roadmap updated: Phases 1-4 marked Done, status summary advanced
 - Build system: added hit_feedback.c

Future work: Phase 5 slash VFX overlay, Phase 6 debug textual overlay & explosion visualization, performance profiling & tuning.

feat(hit-system): tunable enemy pursuit offset (Shift+1..4 + JSON persistence)

Added pursue_offset_x/pursue_offset_y to hitbox tuning JSON; load/save extended.
Shift + (1/2) adjusts X, (3/4) adjusts Y, 9 resets, 0 saves (mirrors existing CTRL/ALT schemes).
Enemy aggro movement now targets player position plus pursue offsets, allowing centering or forward lead tweaks to align attack capsule visually.

feat(debug): render enemy pursuit target (red circle)

Draws a small red circle at player position + pursue_offset (when hit debug enabled) so designers can visually align AI approach point with weapon capsule center.
