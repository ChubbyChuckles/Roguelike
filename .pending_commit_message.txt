AI Phase 9.4 & 9.5: Agent Pooling + 200-Agent Stress Test

Phase 9.4:
- Added ai/core/ai_agent_pool.{c,h} slab allocator for EnemyAIBlackboard blocks (reuse vs malloc/free churn)
- Integrated pool into enemy_ai_bt enable/disable (rogue_ai_agent_acquire/release)
- Diagnostic APIs: rogue_ai_agent_pool_{in_use,free,peak,reset_for_tests,slab_size}
- New unit test test_ai_phase9_agent_pool validates reuse across cycles, peak stability, no leaks

Phase 9.5:
- New stress test test_ai_phase9_stress spawning 200 enemies; two-phase scheduler + LOD validation
	* Phase 1: LOD radius 30 ensures only near subset moves (assert moved_near>=25, far static)
	* Phase 2: Radius expanded to 400; previously far agents begin moving (assert moved_far>=100)
	* Verifies agent pool peak == 200 and scheduler advanced 128 frames over 8 buckets
- README & roadmap updated with Phase 9.5 section/status

Notes:
- Maintains SDL-enabled build
- Provides regression guard for large-wave AI scalability and pooling correctness
