Integration Plumbing: Wire auto rollback into transaction abort; add unit test; update roadmap/README

- Phase 5.4: Implemented automatic rollback invocation from transaction abort path.
  - transaction_manager.c now includes rollback_manager.h and calls
    rogue_rollback_auto_for_participant(...) for each marked participant during abort.
  - Counts rollback invocation in stats; participant on_abort still notified.
- Added unit test test_sync_phase5_8_auto_rollback exercising prepare-failure path and
  validating RogueRollbackStats.auto_rollbacks/restores_performed and auto-triggered event.
- Registered the test in tests/CMakeLists.txt (SDL2 linked when available).
- Updated roadmap Phase 5.4 summary to reflect completion of auto-rollback wiring and added test reference.

Build: Debug, SDL2, -j8; Phase 5.8 sync tests (including new auto_rollback) pass.Integration Phase 3.6.6–3.6.7: Add specialization subsystem and integrate into damage/cooldown

- Implemented progression_specialization module (C, no C++) with per-skill path selection: POWER (+10% damage) and CONTROL (−10% cooldown)
- Public APIs: init/shutdown, choose/get/respec, damage_scalar(), cooldown_scalar(); respec consumes attribute respec tokens
- Integrated specialization scalars in damage_calc for Fireball damage and cooldown paths alongside synergy, INT scaling, and mastery
- Added unit test test_progression_phase3_6_specialization validating baseline → POWER damage increase, respec token consumption, CONTROL cooldown reduction; success token PH3_6_SPECIALIZATION_OK
- Wired new module and test into CMake; built with SDL2 and parallelism (-j8)
- Updated roadmap (3.6.6–3.6.7) and README changelog

feat(integration-plumbing): JSON migration for Materials & Crafting with validations and tests

- Phase 2.3.3 complete (Materials & Crafting JSON):
	- Materials: `rogue_material_registry_load_path` now supports JSON; added tier helpers
		`rogue_material_find_by_category_and_tier` and `rogue_material_next_tier_index`.
	- Gathering: `rogue_gather_defs_load_path` JSON branch supports node defs with weighted materials,
		deterministic spawn/harvest, tool tier gating, and rare proc fields.
	- Crafting: `rogue_craft_load_json` parses recipes (inputs/outputs, time_ms, station, skill_req, exp_reward).
		Added validations: `rogue_craft_validate_dependencies`, `rogue_craft_validate_balance(min,max)`,
		`rogue_craft_validate_skill_requirements`.
- Tests: Added `test_materials_and_gathering_json` and `test_crafting_json_and_validations`; registered in CTest.
	Both pass in Debug with SDL2 and -j8.
- Build: Kept SDL2 enabled; MSBuild parallel builds via CMake `--parallel 8`.
- Docs: Roadmap updated (2.3.3 marked Done with summary). README changelog notes new JSON loaders and validations.

feat(worldgen-json): Phase 2.3.4 biomes & vegetation JSON loaders, validations, and tests

- Biomes: Added `world_gen_biome_json.c/.h` with C-only parsers to load biome defs, normalize tile weights,
	build transition/compatibility matrix, and validate encounter tables and balance ranges.
- Vegetation: Added `vegetation_json.c/.h` to ingest plants and trees from JSON; introduced internal
	registration helper `rogue__vegetation_register_def` in `vegetation_defs.c` and declared in
	`vegetation_internal.h` for safe registry appends.
- Build: Wired new modules into `CMakeLists.txt`; SDL2 remains required; built with `--parallel 8`.
- Tests: Added `test_worldgen_phase3_4_biome_json` and `test_vegetation_json`; both pass in Debug under SDL2 with -j8.
- Roadmap: Updated 2.3.4 items to Done for biomes/vegetation migration, transitions, balance, and encounters;
	left resource nodes and asset dependency validation for a follow-up.

feat(worldgen-json): Complete Phase 2.3.4 with resource nodes + asset dependency validation

- Implemented resource node JSON loader (`world_gen_resource_json.c/.h`): parses id, rarity,
	tool_tier, yield_min/max, biome_mask or biomes[]; validates ranges; defaults to non-ocean biomes;
	registers via `rogue_resource_register` and integrates with generation.
- Implemented biome asset dependency validator (`world_gen_biome_assets_validate.c/.h`): scans
	biome tile/sprite references and verifies texture file existence with robust relative fallbacks
	(as-is, ../, ../../) for ctest working directories.
- Tests: Added `test_resource_json` and `test_biome_assets_validate`; fixed initialization & path
	handling; both pass in Debug under SDL2 with parallel build (-j8).
- Docs: Roadmap 2.3.4.3 and 2.3.4.7 marked Done with updated SUMMARY; README changelog updated.
