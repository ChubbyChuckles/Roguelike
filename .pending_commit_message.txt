feat(skills): input buffering (1A.1 partial), adaptive haste (1A.3 partial), channel ticks & cast speed tests

Implements per-skill input buffering: queued cast skills (and buffered instants with buffer window) activate immediately after current cast completes using new `queued_trigger_ms` and existing `queued_until_ms` fields. Adds unit test `test_input_buffer_cast`.

Adds adaptive haste prototype (Phase 1A.3 partial): reuses POWER_STRIKE buff magnitude as a temporary haste scalar affecting cast progression speed and channel tick interval (faster with higher buff). Unit test `test_haste_cast_speed` validates reduced completion time.

Extends channel system (1A.5 partial previously) now interacting with haste for tick interval scaling. Existing `test_channel_ticks_and_buffer` still valid.

Roadmap updates: 1A.1, 1A.3, 1A.5, 1A.6 set to Partial with specifics (buffering, haste speed, ticks, tests). README earlier updated with input buffering & channel ticks; future update will add haste note.

Next targets: early cancel scaling (1A.4), drift correction for channel ticks, dedicated haste buff type, DOT/HOT EffectSpec kinds, combo builder/spender logic.
