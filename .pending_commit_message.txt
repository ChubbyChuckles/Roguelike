persistence: fix checksum logic (binary reopen), add format version & migration registry scaffolding

- Added ROGUE_SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION (v1) + migration registration API.
- Implemented checksum computation fix: reopen temp file in binary read mode, recompute CRC32 over post-header bytes, rewrite header (resolves load -7 mismatch).
- Added test reset helper and migration registry structures.
- Updated roadmap: Phase 2 items (2.1 Done, 2.2 Partial), Testing 10.1 Partial.
- Expanded README with Persistence section detailing Phase 1 completion & Phase 2 kickoff.
- Roundtrip test remains for integrated components; per-section & fuzz tests upcoming.
