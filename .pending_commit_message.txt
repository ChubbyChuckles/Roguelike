Equipment System Phase 1 - Slot Expansion (Initial)
- Added expanded equipment slot enum: weapon, offhand, full armor set (head/chest/legs/hands/feet), jewelry (ring1/ring2/amulet), utility (belt/cloak), charms (charm1/charm2).
- Implemented offhand slot and two-handed occupancy plumbing (detection now data-driven via item definition flags).
- Updated stat cache armor aggregation to ignore jewelry/charms & include new armor slots.
- Added placeholder category mapping (offhand/jewelry temporarily treated as armor category until distinct categories introduced).
- Added basic unit test `test_equipment_phase1_slots` ensuring new headers compile & slot API callable.

Equipment System Phase 1.2/1.4/1.6 - Two-Hand Flag & Persistence
- Added equipment two-handed flag (item definition bitmask) + parsing (optional flags column) and persistence of expanded equipment slots (count + per-slot instance indices).
- Implemented two-hand occupancy logic (auto-clear offhand, block offhand equip) using flags.
- Updated roadmap & README; save loader backward compatible (conditional read of slot block).

Equipment System Phase 1.5 - Cosmetic Transmog Layer
- Implemented per-slot cosmetic transmog override API (`rogue_equip_set_transmog` / `rogue_equip_get_transmog`).
- Category validation ensures visual override shares category with target slot (prevents weapon-as-helm misuse).
- Added unit test `test_equipment_phase1_transmog` covering set, reject mismatch, clear operations.
- Roadmap updated: 1.5 & 1.6 marked Done; 1.7 tests partial (persistence roundtrip & multi-slot atomicity still pending).

README: Document transmog test addition
 - Extended Equipment System Phase 1 section to mention cosmetic transmog layer and dedicated test.
