UI Phase 10.3: Automated Navigation Traversal Test

Summary:
- Added new test `test_ui_phase10_navigation_traversal.c` exercising directional focus navigation (RIGHT & DOWN) across a deterministic 2x3 button grid.
- Validates horizontal wrap after visiting all 6 focusable widgets (guards against focus traps / skipped widgets).
- Validates vertical row transitions and wrap per column (ensures DOWN cycles rows consistently).
- Integrates test into CMake (`test_ui_phase10_navigation_traversal`).
- Marks Phase 10.3 as Done in `roadmaps/implementation_plan_uisystem.txt` with reference to test.
- README updated with bullet noting Phase 10.3 completion.

Motivation:
Ensures regression protection for navigation heuristic changes (spatial search + linear fallback). Any future heuristic tweak causing non-unique traversal or broken wrap will fail the test.

Notes:
- Leaves existing debug instrumentation in ui_context (INIT_* / PUSH_NODE) untouched for now; can be pruned or macro-guarded in a subsequent cleanup commit once stability confirmed.

No functional runtime UI changes beyond test harness; risk minimal.
