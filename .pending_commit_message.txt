Itemsystem Phase 20.1: Loot Table Parser Fuzz Harness

Summary:
- Added new unit test `test_loot_phase20_1_fuzz_tables` generating 1200 randomized/malformed loot table lines (well-formed entries, missing rolls, long IDs, random noise, comments, empty lines).
- Synthetic item defs (10 minimal entries) loaded into a temporary file to permit a subset of valid references while exercising invalid ids (>=10) and negative/zero weights.
- Fuzz lines vary quantity ranges (including reversed to test qmax<qmin correction), rarity min/max (negative, reversed), and include segments with invalid structure.
- Ensures loader:
	* Never crashes or hangs under large malformed input corpus.
	* Respects caps (`ROGUE_MAX_LOOT_TABLES`, `ROGUE_MAX_LOOT_ENTRIES`).
	* Ignores entries with invalid item index or non-positive weight (no unintended entry_count inflation).
	* Clamps negative rolls/quantity/rarity fields consistent with existing parser logic.
- Spot checks a known table (`TAB0`) for entry cap integrity.

Roadmap / Docs:
- Marked roadmap Phase 20.1 as Done with description.
- Updated README (Recent Loot Phases section) adding Phase 20.1 QA note and rationale (preps for statistical harness Phases 20.2â€“20.3).

Build/Test Integration:
- Registered new test executable in `tests/CMakeLists.txt` with SDL guard macro.

Next Steps (Phase 20.x):
- 20.4 Affix round-trip stress (randomized item generation + save/load cycles).
- 20.5 Max ground item + merge performance stress scenario.

Itemsystem Phases 20.2 & 20.3: Statistical Harness + Rarity Regression

Summary:
- Added `test_loot_phase20_2_3_stats_regression` performing 100k deterministic roll iterations against table ORC_BASE, tracking rarity frequencies for long_sword band (0-2).
- Validates each rarity appears at least once and no rarity deviates >0.15 absolute from uniform expectation (~0.333) establishing an early skew detection guard.
- Roadmap updated marking 20.2 (statistical harness) and 20.3 (probability regression) Done; README updated with new entry.
- Provides baseline empirical tolerance prior to introducing more sophisticated adaptive weighting or pity tuning changes; future adjustments that systematically bias distribution will fail this test.
