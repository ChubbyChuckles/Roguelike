feat(equipment/phase9): loadout optimizer (snapshot diff, hill-climb DPS maximizer, constraint gating, evaluated cache) + tests

Implements Equipment System Phase 9 (9.1â€“9.5):
 - Snapshot & compare APIs (rogue_loadout_snapshot/compare/hash)
 - Deterministic hill-climb optimizer maximizing DPS under mobility/EHP thresholds
 - Evaluated combination cache (FNV-1a hash, open addressing) with stats accessor
 - Added unit test test_equipment_phase9_loadout_opt covering snapshot diff, optimization improvement non-decrease, cache instrumentation
 - Roadmap & README updated, macro slot count wired
 - Provides extendable foundation for future multi-objective & parallel search (Phase 14.4)

feat(equipment/phase10.4): item quality metric (0-20) scaling base damage + API + tests

- Added quality field to `RogueItemInstance` with linear scaling (max +10% at quality 20) applied to base weapon damage before affixes & fracture penalty.
- Introduced API: get/set/improve quality functions with clamping.
- Unit test `test_equipment_phase10_quality` ensures monotonic scaling and clamp behavior.
- Roadmap updated (10.4 Done, 10.6 partial), README documents feature.
