Character Progression Phase 12 Completion: Added V3 progression persistence (progression_persist.c/h)
- Version bump to 3 with new ProgHeaderV3 including attr_op_count and passive unlock list
- Passive unlock sparse list serialization (node_id,timestamp placeholder) with deterministic ordering
- Attribute operation journal (code,kind) persisted & replayed; migration flag ATTR_REPLAY
- Migration flags extended (TALENT_SCHEMA, ATTR_REPLAY); existing STAT_REG fingerprint check retained
- Backwards compatibility loader now supports V1, V2, V3 with replay and chain hash parity
- Added attribute journal infrastructure (ops array) & public accessors for persistence tests
- Extended tests: new test_progression_phase12_v3 validates roundtrip, replay counts (3 ops), chain hash stability
- Roadmap Phase 12.2â€“12.5 marked Done; README changelog updated

Vendor System Phase 4 Completion: Reputation & Negotiation Implementation
- Added vendor_reputation.c/h module providing per-vendor reputation tracking with diminishing returns (logistic scaling)
- Reputation gain API (rogue_vendor_rep_gain) and raw adjust for penalties; progress & tier query helpers
- Deterministic negotiation attempt (rogue_vendor_attempt_negotiation) using attribute-derived skill tag scores (insight->intelligence, finesse->dexterity) + d20 style roll
- Success yields uniform discount within rule range, small rep gain, short lockout (5s); failure applies rep penalty (-1), longer lockout (10s)
- Added Phase 4 unit test (test_vendor_phase4_reputation_negotiation) verifying diminishing rep deltas and increased negotiation success with higher attributes
- Updated CMake to compile vendor_reputation module & register new test; roadmap Phase 4 entries marked Done
