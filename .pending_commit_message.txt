UI: Implement Phase 4.2 & 4.3 Inventory Interactions

Details:
- Added drag & drop support to `rogue_ui_inventory_grid` (drag begin/end events, slot swap including empty target).
- Introduced lightweight UI event queue + `rogue_ui_poll_event` API (ring buffer size 32).
- Implemented stack split modal (CTRL+click to open, wheel to adjust, Activate to apply, release to cancel) with OPEN/APPLY/CANCEL events.
- Added unit test `test_ui_phase4_drag_stack` covering drag begin/end, swap integrity, drag to empty slot, stack split apply, and cancel path.
- Updated roadmap marking Phase 4.2 & 4.3 Done; README UI section documents new behaviors.
- Minor test robustness improvements: event polling now drains queue to prevent missed events.

Follow-ups (deferred): ghost item rendering during drag, snapback animation, scroll virtualization & context menus (Phase 4.4+).
