Skillsystem Phase 6.2–6.3: Aura spatial hook + exclusivity groups; tests green (Debug SDL2, -j8)

- Add AURA spatial inclusion via rogue_collect_enemies_in_radius in pulse path; maintain determinism and standard mitigation/crit pipeline.
- Implement aura exclusivity: group mask with replace-if-stronger semantics; ignore weaker re-applies; per-target active tracking.
- Fix/solidify event loop from prior refactor; ensure deterministic (when_ms, seq) ordering across effects.
- Tests: add/enable test_effectspec_aura_exclusive; verify alongside test_effectspec_aura_basic and existing EffectSpec suite (ctest -C Debug -j8 all green).
- Docs: update roadmap (Phase 6.1–6.4 statuses) and README (Auras exclusivity note).

Build: CMake multi-config Debug with SDL2 enabled; parallel build (-j8).

Skillsystem Phase 7.1: Event bus integration for skill_channel_tick and combo_spend; tests green (Debug SDL2, -j16)

- Enumerate and document new event IDs:
	- ROGUE_EVENT_SKILL_CHANNEL_TICK (0x0701) with payload { skill_id, tick_index (1-based), when_ms }.
	- ROGUE_EVENT_SKILL_COMBO_SPEND (0x0702) with payload { skill_id, amount, when_ms }.
- Publish points:
	- Channel loop publishes CHANNEL_TICK at deterministic tick boundaries (drift-corrected to channel_start_ms).
	- Combo spend published for channel spenders and instant spender activation before zeroing combo.
- Unit test: add tests/unit/test_skills_phase7_event_bus.c that subscribes to both events, simulates time, pumps the event bus, and asserts receipt.
- Roadmap/README: mark Phase 7.1 Done; add README section “Skill Events on the Event Bus (Phase 7.1)” with usage notes.
- Verification: Debug build with SDL2 and -j16; targeted skills/event-bus tests and broader skills suite pass.
