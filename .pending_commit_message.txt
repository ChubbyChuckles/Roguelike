Persistence: Phase 4.2 Replay Hash (v8)

* Bump save format to v8 (replay hash + tamper recovery groundwork)
* Added component id 8 (replay) capturing deterministic gameplay-critical input events (frame,action,value)
* Implemented replay event recording API: rogue_save_replay_record_input, reset, hash accessors
* SHA256 digest computed over event array persisted with count for divergence detection
* Updated migration chain with v7->v8 stub, component auto-registered when format>=8
* Added unit test test_save_v8_replay_hash validating hash stability and count on save/load roundtrip
* Roadmap & README updated to mark Phase 4.2 complete
