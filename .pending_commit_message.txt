UI Phase 10.1: Add headless UI harness & deterministic tree hash

Summary:
- Implemented Phase 10.1 headless harness (roadmap) providing `rogue_ui_headless_run` and `rogue_ui_tree_hash` for deterministic single-frame UI builds without renderer.
- Added new public typedef `RogueUIBuildFn` and APIs in `ui_context.h`.
- Integrated implementation in `ui_context.c` reusing existing serialization+FNV1a64 hashing path.
- Created unit test `test_ui_phase10_headless_harness` verifying stable hash across runs with identical build function.
- Updated roadmap marking 10.1 as Done with test reference.

Rationale:
Enables upcoming Phase 10 automation (navigation traversal, performance smoke, golden image hash precursor) by supplying a minimal deterministic execution harness.

Notes / Next Steps:
- Golden image diff (10.2) will wrap headless harness with offline raster or stubbed drawlist capture.
- Navigation traversal test (10.3) can iterate frames with synthetic inputs recording focus order & verifying wrap invariants.
- Consider exposing node_count & diff hash directly from harness for chained multi-frame runs.
