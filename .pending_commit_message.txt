feat(skills): EffectSpec minimal system (1.2 partial) + AP soft throttle (1.5 complete)

Adds foundational EffectSpec registry (`effect_spec.c/h`) with initial STAT_BUFF kind and automatic application via `RogueSkillDef.effect_spec_id` during activation.
Introduces new buff type `ROGUE_BUFF_STAT_STRENGTH` and unit test `test_effectspec_basic` validating application.
Completes AP economy Phase 1.5 by implementing soft throttle: large AP spends trigger temporary slowed regen (interval increase + gain reduction) with test `test_ap_soft_throttle` plus existing `test_skills_ap_economy`.
Roadmap updated (1.2 Partial, 1.5 Done). README updated (Combat & Skills + changelog snapshot) to reflect soft throttle and EffectSpec.

Adds initial casting & channel support (1.3/1.4 partial): new fields `cast_time_ms`, `cast_type`, runtime flags, delayed effect on cast completion, channel duration tracking; test `test_skill_cast_and_channel` validates delayed completion and single-tick channel start.

Implements basic channel tick scheduler (1A.5 partial):
 - New state field `channel_next_tick_ms`.
 - Fixed 250ms quantum ticking for channel skills (immediate + periodic ticks until end).
 - EffectSpec application now occurs on each channel tick.
 - Unit test `test_channel_ticks_and_buffer` validates expected tick count over 800ms channel.
README & roadmap updated: 1A.5 marked Partial.

Next: input buffering window (1A.1), drift-corrected tick scheduler & dynamic haste adjustment, additional EffectSpec kinds (DOT/HOT), stacking rules, snapshot vs dynamic scaling flags, combo builder/spender logic, proc system groundwork.
