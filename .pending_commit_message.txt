feat(persistence): implement Phase 3.6 per-section compression (v6)

* Bumped save format to v6 introducing optional RLE compression per section
* Added API rogue_save_set_compression(enabled,min_bytes) controlling threshold
* High bit of 32-bit section size marks compressed; payload begins with uncompressed size (uint32) then RLE (byte,run) pairs
* Writer chooses compression when size>=min and compressed smaller than original
* Loader transparently decompresses into temp buffer before invoking component read_fn
* Added migration v5->v6 (no-op) and unit test test_save_v6_compression validating save/load under compression
* Roadmap & README updated with v6 details
