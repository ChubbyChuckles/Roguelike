AI Phase 9.2/9.3: Incremental evaluation scheduler + LOD gating

Adds ai/core/ai_scheduler.{c,h} implementing:
 - Bucketed frame distribution (configurable via rogue_ai_scheduler_set_buckets)
 - Distance-based LOD radius (rogue_ai_lod_set_radius) skipping full BT ticks for far agents
 - Cheap maintenance tick placeholder for skipped agents (future timers/decay)
Integrates scheduler into enemy_system_ai update (BT-enabled enemies now tick via scheduler).
Enhances robustness of rogue_enemy_ai_bt_enable (rebuild tree if flag set but tree missing).
Increases MoveToPlayer action speed to 5.0f to ensure detectable movement in tests.
New unit test test_ai_phase9_incremental_lod validates:
 - Near agent moves under bucketed scheduling
 - Far agent excluded while outside LOD radius
 - Movement begins after expanding LOD radius
Roadmap updated marking 9.2/9.3 Done; README documents scheduler & LOD controls.
