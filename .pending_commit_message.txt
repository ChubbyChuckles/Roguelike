combat: restore golden player damage numbers + Phase 1A frame cache & overlap tests

Fix:
 - Player damage (golden) numbers regressed (combat strike path never spawned numbers). Added `rogue_add_damage_number_ex` call in `rogue_combat_player_strike` for each enemy hit (from_player=1, crit=0 placeholder) restoring visual feedback.

New Test:
 - `test_damage_numbers_player` ensures one golden damage number spawns on a player strike and asserts `from_player==1`, `crit==0`.

Recent Phase 1A Additions (context):
 - Frame span cache (1A.1), overlapping heavy_2 windows (0-50,40-80,80-105), boundary/overlap test, event consume API.

Quality:
 - Built with SDL enabled; new and existing combat tests pass (spot-run damage_numbers_player).

Next Steps:
 - Integrate crit determination on player strikes, Phase 2 mitigation pipeline, FX/SFX consumer of combat events.
