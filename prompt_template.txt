### Skillsystem

Read the implementation_plan_skillsystem.txt, go to the next features in line that need implementation and implement as many of them as possible. Use unit tests and modularize the code as much as possible to prevent regression. Never build without SDL2. After a successful implementation update the implementation_plan_skillsystem.txt, generate a descriptive commit message and update the README.md. Iterate this process as often as you can in one request.
