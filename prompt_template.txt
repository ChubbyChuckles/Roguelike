Read the implementation_plan.txt, go to the next features in line that need implementation and implement as many of them as possible. Use unit tests and modularize the code as much as possible to prevent regression. After a successful implementation update the implementation_plan.txt and generate a descriptive commit message and update the README.md. Iterate this process as often as you can in one request.
