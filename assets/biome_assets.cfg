# Biome-specific tile variants template
# Lines starting with # are comments.
# Declare a biome section with: BIOME <BiomeName>
# Follow with TILE lines providing additional variants for core tiles.
# Format (comma after TILE optional):
#   TILE,NAME,path/to/sheet.png,col,row
# or TILE NAME, path/to/sheet.png, col,row
# NAME tokens match enum names without prefix (GRASS, WATER, FOREST, MOUNTAIN, CAVE_WALL, CAVE_FLOOR, RIVER, SWAMP, SNOW, RIVER_DELTA, RIVER_WIDE)
# Multiple variants for same NAME allowed; selection is deterministic per (x,y).
