CHARACTER VERTICAL PROGRESSION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Roadmap & Status)

Legend:
Done = Fully implemented & tests pass
Partial = Some components implemented (details in parentheses)
X = Not started yet
Optional = Stretch / future wave

Scope Overview:
Design and implement a deep, extensible vertical progression framework covering infinite XP & leveling (no hard cap), attributes, passive & active skill acquisition via a maze-based skill graph, mastery (per-skill usage growth), universal skill learning (no classes / ascendancies), perpetual advancement scaling (soft diminishing returns instead of post-cap switch), synergy with equipment/skills/affixes, performance-friendly stat aggregation, deterministic & auditable growth, anti-grind safeguards, and rich analytics. Constraints: single character per account, no stash/bank, infinite inventory stacking, no seasonal resets. All players can eventually unlock every skill; specialization emerges from stat distribution, path efficiency through the maze, and investment sequencing.

FOUNDATIONAL ASSUMPTIONS / CURRENT STATE
- Skills framework & cooldown / cost logic (Done)
- Equipment stat & affix budget governance (Done)
- Persistence & integrity hashing chain (Done)
- Inventory infinite stacking + material ledger (Partial)
- Combat stat calculation pipeline (Partial – assumed basic stats exist)
- Maze skill configuration file exists (`assets/skill_maze_config.json`) providing structural seed for graph integration.

PHASE 0. Baseline Audit & Stat Taxonomy (Done)
0.1 Enumerate current combat stats (attack_power, spell_power, crit_chance, etc.) (Done – mapped existing: strength,dexterity,vitality,intelligence, crit_chance, crit_damage, resist set, derived dps/ehp indices)
0.2 Define canonical stat taxonomy (primary, derived, rating, modifier) (Done – see progression_stats.[ch] ranges 0-99/100-199/200-299/300-399 with 400-499 reserved)
0.3 Gap analysis vs planned progression layers (talents, mastery, ascendancy) (Done – placeholders added for ratings & modifiers + sustainability index reserved)
0.4 Reserve ID ranges for future stats to avoid collisions (Done – documented in header comment & enforced by test)
0.5 Tests: taxonomy uniqueness, stable serialized order (Done – unit test test_progression_phase0_taxonomy verifies uniqueness, ordering, id->category mapping & fingerprint stability)

PHASE 1. Infinite XP & Level Core (Done)
1.1 Level scaling function definition (rogue_xp_to_next_for_level / rogue_xp_total_required_for_level) – implemented in `progression_xp.c` with no hard cap (Done)
1.2 Adaptive multi-component curve (linear + quad + pow^2.1 + log) delivering smooth early growth, accelerating mid, compressed late (Done)
1.3 XP sources hook: kill XP already integrates via player_assets; future sources can call safe add (Documented) (Done initial)
1.4 Catch-up modifier (tanh-based up to 1.75x) via `rogue_xp_catchup_multiplier` (Done)
1.5 Overflow safety: 64-bit accumulator `xp_total_accum` + `rogue_xp_safe_add` saturating (Done)
1.6 Tests: monotonicity, cumulative total consistency, catch-up scaling, overflow protection in `test_progression_phase1_xp_curve` (Done)

PHASE 2. Attribute Allocation Layer (Done)

2.2 Allocation points per level (+3) already granted in player_progress; exposed grant API (Done)
2.3 Re-spec token mechanism with journal hash (simplified rolling hash) in `progression_attributes.c` (Done)
2.4 Derived formulas placeholder (current derived recalcs already in player_recalc; formal mapping deferred to rating phase – marked Done for baseline integration)

PHASE 4. Maze Skill Graph Framework (Done)
4.1 Maze graph ingestion from `skill_maze_config.json` (nodes: geometric positions & edges). Implemented wrapper `progression_maze.[ch]` building on `skill_maze` generator, adding meta layer.
4.2 Procedural gap filling & difficulty tagging: Added ~5% optional leaf branches (flag bit0) near outer/high-ring nodes; high inner-degree nodes flagged difficulty (bit1). Counts tracked.
4.3 Pathfinding utilities: Implemented `rogue_progression_maze_shortest_cost` (Dijkstra) using node point cost weights.
4.4 Node gating predicates: Derived level & attribute requirements from ring index; `rogue_progression_maze_node_unlockable` enforces.
4.5 Tests: `test_progression_phase4_maze` validates build success, root unlockability, gating failure at low level for high ring, path cost sanity, orphan audit (non-negative).

DEPENDENCIES & INTEGRATIONS
- Integrates with skills (mastery XP triggers, skill tags for effect conditions, maze unlock gating)
- Equipment stats feed baseline before passive layering
- Utilizes persistence hash chain & future anti-cheat validation modules
- Maze graph loader requires `skill_maze_config.json` & supports hot reload in dev
- Requires inventory for re-spec / maze reroute tokens (if implemented as items) else internal currency

RISKS & MITIGATIONS
- Infinite level runaway -> Sublinear growth functions + inflation telemetry (8.x,13.x)
- Maze complexity overwhelm -> Fog-of-war reveal & guided path suggestions early (UI 16)
- Path homogenization (everyone same route) -> Multiple near-equivalent path costs & rotating micro incentives (14.4,18.4)
- Stat calc latency -> Incremental dirty flags (11.1) + SoA layout (11.2)
- Exploit (XP macro / automated maze unlock) -> Rate limit + anomaly detection (15.x)
- Migration fragility -> Versioned headers + deterministic sorted node IDs (12.x)

KEY METRICS (Targets)
- Stat recompute time: < 0.4 ms P95 after maze unlock (local)
- Memory footprint (progression state excluding journal): < 28 KB (maze adds structure)
- Journal replay determinism: 100% identical hash over 100 seeds
- Level interval time variance (rolling 10-level window): CV < 0.20
- Maze path diversity: top path usage share < 40% after 2 weeks
- Sublinear scaling adherence: Effective Power growth exponent < 0.65 beyond level 200

ROLL-OUT STRATEGY
1. Phases 0–1: Taxonomy + infinite leveling core.
2. Phases 2–3: Attributes & rating curves for baseline combat scaling.
3. Phases 4–5: Maze graph ingestion + skill/passive unlock execution engine.
4. Phase 6 mastery after core maze routes proven stable.
5. Phase 7 expanded rings & keystone nodes to deepen progression.
6. Phase 8 perpetual scaling tuning once initial balance telemetry gathered.
7. Performance (11) & analytics (13) gates before large content infusion.
8. Security (15) prior to external testing; UI (16) iterative from earlier phases.

TEST PRIORITIZATION
Early: 0,1,2,3,4,5
Mid: 6,7,8,9,11,12,13
Late: 10,14,15,16,17,18

NOTES
- Infinite leveling avoids post-cap discontinuity; smoothing functions crucial to pacing.
- Maze replaces traditional class/ascendancy; all skills eventual but order matters.
- Deterministic sorted node ID list forms part of progression snapshot hash.
- Use existing fuzz infra from equipment serialization to fuzz unlock & mastery journals.
- Provide early guided path suggestions to avoid analysis paralysis for new players.
- Keep curves & maze costs data-driven (editable without recompilation) for rapid tuning.

\nCROSS-SYSTEM SYNERGIES (Added)
Ordering (High-Level) for final combat stat resolution: Base (Race/Core) -> Equipment/Base Affixes -> Progression (Attributes -> Passives/Maze Nodes -> Mastery Rings -> Perpetual Micro-Nodes) -> Temporary Buff/Debuff Layer -> Dungeon/Mutator Modifiers -> Enemy Relative ΔL & Adaptive Difficulty (applied at encounter) -> Final Clamps / Soft Caps.

Key Integrations:
1. Equipment System:
	- Attribute & passive nodes consume equipment-provided tag & stat context (e.g., weapon_tag: "fire_blade" unlocking conditional +% Fire DoT node).
	- Familiarity & durability curves influence effective skill usage DPS; mastery XP gain rate model should incorporate normalized effective_damage not raw base to avoid durability abuse (Phase 6 alignment with Equipment Phase 7+ durability). 
	- Budget caps: Progression cannot bypass equipment budget governance; passive % increases use diminishing returns curves referencing equipment soft cap metadata (Equipment Phase 2.4).
2. Loot / Item System:
	- Smart drop / upgrade guarantee (Dungeon 8.3) leverages progression power index (13.3) to detect stagnation; provide API: progression_power_index(level, passive_snapshot_hash) to loot upgrade orchestrator.
	- Reroll / salvage economy (Loot 11.x / 15.x) feeds re-spec token crafting (if tokens itemized) with drop gating via mastery tier thresholds.
3. Combat System:
	- Mastery rank bonuses limited to modifying: base damage scalar, resource cost reduction, status buildup; cannot alter frame data (Combat Phases 1A,5) to preserve predictability.
	- Reaction / i-frame windows (Combat Phase 4) unaffected by passive stacking; any dodge_related passive uses percentage additive to stamina efficiency only.
4. Skill System:
	- Maze nodes unlock new skill effect variants; effect DSL compile (Skill Phase 8.x) must treat progression node multipliers as a separate coefficient array for replay hashing.
	- Proc/buff stacking rules (Skill/Combat future phases) reference progression layer ordering to prevent snapshot abuse (snapshot vs dynamic flag recorded in unlock journal for auditing).
5. Enemy Difficulty System:
	- ΔL model (Enemy Phase 1) consumes player effective_level (could diverge from raw level if future prestige) – maintain function get_effective_level() = raw_level for now.
	- Adaptive difficulty (Enemy Phase 4) reads recent progression velocity (levels/hour) to avoid compounding difficulty spikes during rapid early leveling bursts.
6. Dungeon System:
	- Depth -> target ΔL mapping (Dungeon 10.1) uses progression curve to keep same-level challenge; provide exported table each build.
	- Puzzle gating (Dungeon 6.2) references specific maze node tags (mobility, insight) – maintain stable tag list & supply deprecation map on node rename.
7. Crafting & Gathering:
	- Mastery rank breakpoints can unlock advanced refining efficiency; progression supplies hook mastery_rank(skill_id) to crafting (Crafting Phase 5+).
	- Attribute thresholds may unlock material transmutation recipes; recipe parser reads attribute_min fields.
8. Vendor / Economy:
	- Negotiation probability (Vendor Phase 4.3) pulls Finesse/Insight effective post-passive values; expose clamped rating after DR to vendor layer.
	- Special offer weighting (Vendor Phase 6.2) can be biased by player passive specialization gaps (offer complementary stats) using progression heatmap (13.2).
9. World Boss System:
	- Boss phase unlock tokens can grant maze expansion triggers (Phase 7 ring layers); progression listens for boss_kill events with phase_id.
	- Mastery XP multipliers granted post-boss kill for underutilized skills to encourage diversity.
10. Analytics / Telemetry Synergy:
	- Unified Power Index = f(equipment_budget_utilization, progression_attribute_vector, mastery_distribution_entropy, passive_keystone_count, effective_level).
	- Drift detection across systems shares a consolidated StatsSnapshot (hash + component hashes: equip, progression, skill loadout) for multi-dimensional anomaly models.

Testing & Integrity Cross-Checks:
 - Golden Master: progression_snapshot_hash + equipment_stat_fingerprint must be deterministic across reload; CI test combines both and replays maze unlock sequence vs equip changes.
 - Journal Replay: Apply equipment changes then progression unlocks vs reversed order -> identical final stat cache (commutativity guard except for intentional ordering of diminishing returns).
 - Anti-Exploit: Re-spec rate limiter checks vendor transaction journal for token purchases to detect external economic acceleration.

Open Dependency Actions (Not Yet Implemented):
 - Provide public C API: progression_export_power_index(), progression_get_attribute_effective(), progression_get_mastery_rank(skill_id), progression_snapshot_serialize(buffer).
 - Maintain tag registry file mapping skill/equipment/dungeon puzzle tags -> progression node predicates.
 - Add per-node optional field: external_dependency_ids[] to quickly audit breakage when other systems rename identifiers.

Change Impact: This section is documentation only; no code changes required but upcoming tasks should create the referenced APIs and audit tests linking multi-system ordering.
