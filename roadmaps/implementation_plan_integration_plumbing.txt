INTEGRATION PLUMBING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Cross-System Communication & Data Flow)

Legend:
Done = Fully implemented & tests pass
Partial = Some components implemented (details in parentheses)
X = Not started yet
Optional = Stretch / future wave

Scope Overview:
Design and implement the foundational integration layer that connects all major game systems (enemy integration, AI, combat, progression, loot, crafting, UI, persistence, world generation) through standardized APIs, event buses, shared data structures, and configuration management. Goals: eliminate system silos, enable seamless cross-system communication, support hot-reloading of JSON configurations, provide deterministic event ordering, maintain backwards compatibility, and establish patterns for future system additions. This forms the backbone that allows independently developed systems to work cohesively in a unified game experience.

FOUNDATIONAL ASSUMPTIONS / CURRENT STATE
- Individual systems implemented with basic functionality (Done – per roadmap analysis)
- Systems use mixed CFG/JSON configuration formats (Current – 78 CFG, 60 JSON files)
- Limited cross-system communication exists (Partial – some direct API calls)
- Save/load system handles individual system persistence (Done)
- No centralized event bus or integration manager (X)
- Systems assume specific initialization order (Partial – implicit dependencies)

DEPENDENCIES & INTEGRATIONS
- Requires all individual systems to be functionally complete (Current state: most systems Done)
- Needs existing persistence system for configuration & state management (Done)
- Uses existing deterministic RNG for event ordering (Done)
- Integrates with existing build system for hot-reload support (Done)
- Future expansion point for multiplayer networking layer (Optional)

RISKS & MITIGATIONS
- Performance overhead from integration layer → Time budget enforcement, lazy evaluation, profiling tools
- Increased complexity from cross-system dependencies → Dependency validation, clear contracts, documentation
- Configuration migration breaking existing saves → Version management, migration validation, rollback support
- Event bus becoming bottleneck → Priority queues, filtering, performance monitoring
- System coupling reducing modularity → Interface standardization, dependency injection, plugin architecture

KEY METRICS (Integration Success Targets)
- All existing system unit tests continue passing: 100%
- Event bus latency: <1ms average, <10ms P99
- JSON hot-reload time: <500ms for any configuration file
- Cross-system transaction success rate: >99.9%
- Memory overhead from integration layer: <5% of total usage
- System initialization time: <2s total for all systems

ROLLOUT STRATEGY
1. Implement Phase 0-1 (architecture + event bus) with minimal system integration
2. Add Phase 2 (JSON standardization) and migrate 25% of CFG files as proof of concept
3. Layer Phase 3 (data flow integration) for core gameplay loop (enemy spawn → combat → loot)
4. Complete Phase 4-5 (optimization + synchronization) for performance & stability
5. Add Phase 6-7 (resource management + tools) for development productivity
6. Finalize Phase 8-9 (error handling + APIs) for robustness & maintainability
7. Optional Phase 10 (advanced features) based on future requirements

TEST PRIORITIZATION
Early: 0, 1, 2, 3
Mid: 4, 5, 6, 7
Late: 8, 9, 10

NOTES
- Integration layer should be transparent to individual systems (minimal API changes)
- Event bus must maintain deterministic ordering for replay consistency
- JSON migration tools should validate 100% data integrity
- Hot-reload must not disrupt active gameplay sessions
- Performance monitoring should be lightweight and always-on
- Error handling should prioritize game session continuity over perfect recovery

FUTURE EXTENSIONS (Post Integration)
- Distributed system coordination for multiplayer
- Real-time system performance analytics dashboard
- Machine learning integration for system optimization
- Cloud configuration management & synchronization
- System behavior prediction & preemptive scaling
- Integration with external tools (editors, debuggers, analytics platforms)

CHANGE IMPACT
- New integration/ module with core interfaces
- Modified system initialization sequences
- Enhanced JSON configuration loading
- Extended save/load format for integration state
- Additional unit & integration test suites
- Updated build system for hot-reload support
