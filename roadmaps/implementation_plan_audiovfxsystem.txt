AUDIO & VFX PIPELINE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Roadmap & Status)

Legend:
Done = Fully implemented & tests pass
Partial = Some components implemented (details in parentheses)
X = Not started yet

Scope Overview:
Unified event-driven audio & visual effects pipeline decoupled from gameplay logic. Goals: minimal latency, pooling, layering, deterministic replay, data-driven authoring, dynamic mixing (ducking, side-chain), adaptive effects scaling (performance modes), and robust headless validation of emission ordering.

PHASE 0. Current Baseline (Partial)
0.1 SDL_mixer init & basic sound load (Partial)
0.2 Hit damage numbers (visual feedback partial) (Partial)
0.3 Simple level-up sound stub (Partial)

2.2 Lazy loading & hot reload detection (Done: lazy Mix_Chunk load on first play; hot reload hook stubbed)
2.3 Channel mixer (gain per category, master mute) (Done: master gain + per-category gains, global mute)
2.4 Voice pool & polyphony limiting (Done: simple voice cap guard; no SDL_mixer -> no-op)
2.5 Randomized multi-sample selection (variation) (Done: deterministic variant selection via xorshift32)
2.6 2D positional panning & distance attenuation stub (Done: listener pos + linear falloff within radius)
2.7 Deterministic seed mapping for repeated events (Done: frame index + seq mixed; repeat scaling in gain)

3.2 Particle system core (emitters, spawn rate, lifetime) (Done: per-registry emitter config, global particle pool (1024), fractional emission accumulator per instance, spawn at instance position, age/expiry; unit test added)
3.3 Object pool for particles & sprite instances (Done: pooled active VFX instances (cap 256) + particle pool (cap 1024))
3.4 Layer ordering (background, mid, foreground, UI) (Partial: layer enum + per-layer counts; ordered layer collection helper + unit test complete; renderer consumption TBD)
3.5 Time scaling integration (hitstop freeze) (Done: timescale scalar + freeze toggle integrated into update/aging)

DEPENDENCIES / RISKS
- Particle batching complexity; may defer GPU path.
- SDL_mixer feature limits (advanced DSP) -> may need abstraction.
- Deterministic ordering must handle concurrent emission gracefully.

SUCCESS METRICS
- <2ms average total audio+VFX CPU under standard combat scenario.
- 100 impact stress test remains within frame budget (no >5% frame spikes).
- Replay hash stable across 10 consecutive runs.

NEXT ACTION CANDIDATES
- Implement Phase 1 + 2 minimal: event bus + basic registry + play sound. (Completed)
- Add particle pool stub & single sparkle effect for loot drop. (Pending; tie into VFX dispatch)

Notes (2025-08-24):
- Added src/audio_vfx/effects.[ch] providing RogueEffectEvent, rogue_fx_emit, frame begin/end, dispatch, and a simple digest (rogue_fx_get_frame_digest).
- Wired app step to tick the FX bus each frame and process dispatch before present.
- Registered LEVELUP sound from assets/sounds.cfg into audio registry and routed level-up cue via bus.
- New unit test tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase1_2.c validates deterministic digest ordering.
 - Implemented frame compaction in dispatcher: identical events (type+priority+id) within a frame are merged and tracked via 'repeats'. Digest now includes repeat count. Added tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase1_5_compaction.c and registered with CTest.
\n+CROSS-SYSTEM SYNERGIES (Added)
Ordering (Frame Pipeline): Collect Gameplay Events -> Normalize & Tag (rarity, biome, material) -> Priority Sort (critical/combat/ui/ambience) -> Budget Cull & Merge -> Dispatch (Audio Mixer / VFX Spawner) -> Instance Update & Lifetime Advance -> Frame Digest Hash Emit.
Inputs Consumed:
 - Combat & Skill: damage_applied, status_proc, cast_phase markers control layered cues (pre-cast, impact, resolve) ensuring synch with hitstop.
 - Equipment & Loot: rarity tier & unique flags drive flourish intensity; proc triggers schedule chained sweetener sounds.
 - AI & World Generation: ambient zone tags (biome, structure) select looping ambience & reverb preset; AI shouts & boss phase transitions raise high-priority ducking events.
 - Persistence/Replay: recorded effect events injected verbatim for determinism validation.
Outputs Provided:
 - Frame effect digest contributes to global integrity chain (H(sorted_event_ids, culled_count, active_voice_ct, active_particle_ct)).
 - Telemetry events (budget_overflow, cull_applied, voice_steal) feed Maintainability analytics & balancing review.
Integrity & Determinism:
 - Stable ordering tuple = (emit_frame, priority, sequence_id); strictly monotonic sequence per producer stream prevents nondeterministic ties.
 - Cross-system replay test: feed captured combat log; expect identical digest across platforms.
Risk Mitigation:
 - Proc chain explosion: per-frame spawn quota & merge strategy (coalesce identical visual within N ms -> intensity scalar ramp). Prevents visual spam & audio clipping.
 - Latency regression guard: probe measuring queue submit -> mixer dispatch; telemetry if >5ms three consecutive frames.
Open Tasks:
 - Expose audio_vfx_get_frame_digest() API for unified replay harness.
 - Add cross-test linking loot generation of unique drop to expected flourish sequence & digest delta.
Change Impact: Documentation only; follow-up adds API & tests.

Notes (2025-08-25):
- Phase 2.2–2.7 implemented in src/audio_vfx/effects.c with compile-time guards for SDL_mixer.
- Mixer APIs: rogue_audio_mixer_set/get_master, set/get_category, set/get_mute. Positional APIs: set listener, enable toggle, falloff radius.
- Deterministic variation: xorshift32 seeded from (event id ^ frame_idx ^ seq); voice cap prevents over-subscription.
- Testing: Added unit tests covering mixer gain math, mute behavior, positional attenuation, and registry clear; all pass under Debug (SDL2, -j8).

Notes (2025-08-26):
- Phase 3.1 (VFX foundations) implemented in src/audio_vfx/effects.[ch]:
	- VFX registry (id -> {layer, world_space, lifetime_ms}) and active instance pool (cap 256).
	- Time controls: global timescale and freeze toggle applied during rogue_vfx_update aging/expiry.
	- Public spawn API (rogue_vfx_spawn_by_id) and dispatcher integration for ROGUE_FX_VFX_SPAWN events.
	- Debug helpers: active counts (total/per-layer) and peek-first for tests.
- Testing: Added tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase3_1_vfx_foundations.c validating spawn via event, layer counts, peek, freeze/timescale behavior, and expiry. CTest -R audio_vfx passes 7/7.

Notes (2025-08-27):
- Phase 3.2 (Particle core) implemented in src/audio_vfx/effects.[ch]:
	- Emitter config per VFX id: rogue_vfx_registry_set_emitter(id, hz, p_lifetime_ms, cap).
	- Global particle pool (1024) with per-instance fractional emission accumulators and per-instance cap enforcement.
	- Update loop spawns particles at owning instance location and ages/expires them; expiry threshold tweaked to strict > lifetime for expected boundary behavior in tests.
- Testing: Added tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase3_2_particles_core.c covering 50 Hz emitters with 200 ms lifetime cap=10 -> counts 5→10→5 stabilization. All audio_vfx tests now pass 8/8 under Debug (SDL2, -j8).

Notes (2025-08-27, continued):
- Phase 3.4 (Layer ordering helper): Implemented ordered layer collection API `rogue_vfx_particles_collect_ordered(uint8_t* out_layers, int max)` returning only layers with active particles in canonical BG→MID→FG→UI order. Intended for renderer iteration.
- Testing: Added unit test `tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase3_4_particle_layer_order.c` validating ordering with/without UI layer. Audio/VFX suite now passes 9/9 in Debug with SDL2 (`ctest -j8 -R audio_vfx`).

Notes (2025-08-28):
- Phase 3.6 (Screen vs World): Added camera state setter `rogue_vfx_set_camera(cam_x, cam_y, pixels_per_world)` and screen-space particle collector `rogue_vfx_particles_collect_screen(float* out_xy, uint8_t* out_layers, int max)`. World-space particles are transformed by subtracting camera and multiplying by pixels_per_world; screen-space particles bypass transform. New unit test `tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase3_6_screen_vs_world.c` validates MID(world) particles offset to expected pixel coords and UI(screen) particles unaffected. Audio/VFX suite now passes 10/10 under Debug SDL2 with `ctest -j8 -R audio_vfx`.

Notes (2025-08-28, later):
- Phase 4.1 (Authoring config loader): Implemented minimal CSV-based VFX config loader `rogue_vfx_load_cfg` in `src/audio_vfx/vfx_config.c/.h`. Supported columns: id, layer (0..3 or BG/MID/FG/UI), lifetime_ms, world_space (0/1 or true/false), emit_hz, particle_lifetime_ms, max_particles. Loader registers VFX and applies emitter settings via `rogue_vfx_registry_set_emitter`. Portable case-insensitive parser avoids non-standard calls; MSVC warnings-as-errors clean. Unit test `tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase4_1_vfx_config_loader.c` creates a temp CSV, loads it, spawns instances, steps update, and asserts particles active on expected layers. Built Debug (SDL2, -j8) and ran `ctest -j8 -R audio_vfx` 2 11/11 passing.

Notes (2025-08-28, even later):
- Phase 4.2 (Hot reload & validation errors): Added `rogue_vfx_config_watch(path)` to monitor a VFX CSV and auto-reload via `rogue_vfx_load_cfg` on content changes using the shared hot-reload utility. Error tracking buffers surfaced through `rogue_vfx_last_cfg_error_count` and `rogue_vfx_last_cfg_error_get` for UI/tools consumption. Unit test `tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase4_2_hot_reload_and_validation.c` validates both live reload (layer change) and error reporting on malformed rows. Audio/VFX suite now passes 12/12 in Debug SDL2 with `ctest -j8 -R audio_vfx`.

Notes (2025-08-28, later again):
- Phase 4.3 (Effect composition): Added composite VFX support with two modes: CHAIN (child delays relative to previous spawn) and PARALLEL (delays from composite start). Registry API `rogue_vfx_registry_define_composite` stores up to 8 child ids and delays, and the update loop schedules child spawns at the composite instance's position. New unit test `tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase4_3_composition.c` verifies order/timing for both modes and expiry. Audio/VFX suite now passes 13/13 in Debug SDL2 with `ctest -j8 -R audio_vfx`.

Notes (2025-08-28, further):
- Phase 4.4 (Parameter overrides): Implemented per-instance VFX overrides and tests.
	- API: `RogueVfxOverrides { lifetime_ms, scale, color_rgba }` and `rogue_vfx_spawn_with_overrides(id, x, y, &ov)`.
	- Runtime: instances honor lifetime override; spawned particles inherit scale (default 1.0) and color (default 0xFFFFFFFF) from the owning instance.
	- Debug helpers: `rogue_vfx_particles_collect_scales` and `rogue_vfx_particles_collect_colors` for tests/tools.
	- Tests: `tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase4_4_parameter_overrides.c` validates override lifetime behavior and presence of particles; audio_vfx suite now passes 14/14 in Debug with SDL2 (`ctest -j8 -R audio_vfx`).

Notes (2025-08-29):
- Phase 4.5 (Random distributions): Implemented per-registry variation for particle scale and lifetime.
	- API: `enum RogueVfxDist { NONE, UNIFORM, NORMAL }` and `rogue_vfx_registry_set_variation(id, scale_mode, a, b, life_mode, a, b)`; debug seed setter `rogue_fx_debug_set_seed`.
	- Runtime: applies uniform [a,b] or normal (mean=a, sigma=b) multipliers to particle scale and lifetime; clamps to small positive; deterministic via xorshift32.
	- Debug helpers: `rogue_vfx_particles_collect_lifetimes` added alongside existing scale/color collectors.
	- Tests: `tests/unit/test_audio_vfx_phase4_5_random_distributions.c` validates bounds and determinism. Audio/VFX suite now passes 15/15 in Debug SDL2 (`ctest -j8 -R audio_vfx`).
