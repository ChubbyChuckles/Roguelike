WORLD GENERATION & PROCEDURAL CONTENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Roadmap & Status)

Legend:
Done = Fully implemented & tests pass (or validated deterministically in headless mode)
Partial = Some components implemented (details in parentheses)
X = Not started yet

Scope Overview:
Layered, deterministic world generation pipeline producing replayable, varied biomes, dungeons, surface overworld, and point-of-interest (POI) structures while supporting runtime streaming, persistence-friendly chunk boundaries, and future mod/data-driven extensions. Emphasis on:
- Determinism (seed -> identical world topology & feature placement)
- Multi-scale generation (macro continental layout -> biome partitioning -> local terrain noise -> micro decoration & loot spawn sets)
- Content layering with strict phase ordering (lower layers never depend on higher layers)
- Performance (parallel chunk precompute, incremental generation caches)
- Testability (unit tests for each algorithmic layer; golden hash snapshots for representative seeds)
- Extensibility (data-driven biome & structure descriptors; plugin hooks for mods)

2.4 River source selection (peak detection & downhill pathfinding to ocean with erosion) (Done: peak selection elev>0.55, downhill greedy descent until sea; erosion deferred to later dedicated phase)

DEPENDENCIES / RISKS
- Complex erosion & river algorithms risk performance spikes; needs profiling & budget instrumentation early.
- Data-driven descriptors must remain backward compatible across schema migrations.
- Parallel generation introduces race risk; must isolate per-chunk buffers.

SUCCESS METRICS
- Seed determinism: identical seed -> identical biome & structure maps (hash equality) across platforms.
- Generation latency: 95% of chunk generations < target ms budget.
- Test coverage: >85% of core generation algorithms lines.

NEXT ACTION CANDIDATES (If starting now)
- Implement Phase 1 foundational config & PRNG channels with unit tests.
- Add golden hash test for macro continent mask (Phase 2.1) using fixed seed.
